                            The Game Master has its own protocol. You must respect it.
                            
                            INPUT YOU SEE:
                            - The goal of the game.
                            - The official protocol description (supplied by the Game Master).
                            - A short history of recent turns (Game Master messages + Player responses).
                            - Feedback from the Game Master about failed actions.
                            
                            YOUR TASK:
                            - Analyze the player's recent responses and the Game Master's feedback.
                            - Identify concrete mistakes the player made (wrong action format, acting on nonexistent objects, using invalid targets, etc.).
                            - For each mistake, also show the correct action that should have been used instead.
                            - Suggest 2â€“3 clear recommendations that will help the player avoid repeating those mistakes.
                            - Do not repeat the exact same advice wording across turns; highlight new aspects or rephrase if needed.
                            - Propose ONE valid next action that follows the protocol and moves toward the goal, based on the most recent Game Master observation.
