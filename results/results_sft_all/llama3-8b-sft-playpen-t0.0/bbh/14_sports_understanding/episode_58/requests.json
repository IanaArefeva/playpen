A more likely description for a basketball player like Clint Capela would be \"Clint Capela dunked\" or \"Clint Capela made a layup.\"\n\nQ: Is the following sentence plausible? \"Nikola Jokic made a three-pointer in the fourth quarter of the game.\"\nA: yes, this is a perfectly plausible sentence as it describes a common action in basketball (making a three-pointer) and a specific context (the fourth quarter of a game).<|eot_id|>",
