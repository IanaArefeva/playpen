In baseball, such a shot would not be a standard play.)\n\nQ: Is the following sentence plausible? \"Neymar Jr. made a three-pointer in the fourth quarter of the game.\"\nA: yes (Neymar is a professional soccer player, and while soccer does not typically involve three-pointers, it's not entirely implausible that a soccer player might make a shot from a distance that could be described as a \"three-pointer\" in a different sport. This sentence is more likely than the previous one, but still a bit stretchy.)\n\nQ: Is the following sentence plausible? \"Lionel Messi made a three-pointer in the fourth quarter of the game.\"\nA: no (Lionel Messi is a professional soccer player, and as with the previous soccer player, it's not entirely implausible that a soccer player might make a shot from a distance that could be described as a \"three-pointer\" in a different sport. This sentence is more likely than the previous one, but still a bit stretchy.)\n\nQ: Is the following sentence plausible? \"Neymar Jr. made a three-pointer in the fourth quarter of the game.\"\nA: no (Neymar is a professional",
