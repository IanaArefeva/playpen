In the Stanley Cup, a trip to the \"penalty box\" is not typically how goals are scored or points are awarded. A more likely event would involve Tavares scoring a goal or assisting on a goal.)\n\nQ: Is the following sentence plausible? \"Nikola Jokić made a three-pointer in the FIBA World Cup.\"\nA: yes (Nikola Jokić is a professional basketball player, and the FIBA World Cup is a major international basketball competition. Jokić could plausibly make a three-pointer in such a setting.)\n\nQ: Is the following sentence plausible? \"Lionel Messi won the gold medal in the 2024 Winter Olympics figure skating competition.\"\nA: no (Lionel Messi is a professional soccer player, and the Winter Olympics feature figure skating and other winter sports. It is highly unlikely that a soccer player like Messi would win a gold medal in figure skating, as it requires specialized skills and training not typically associated with soccer players.)||",
