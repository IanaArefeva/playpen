The correct term for a play where a wide receiver runs a curved path is \"wheel route\" or \"swing route\", but in this context, it's more likely that the play is a \"wheel\" play involving the center, not a wide receiver. A more likely term for a wide receiver's play is \"swing\" or \"slant\".)<|eot_id|>",
