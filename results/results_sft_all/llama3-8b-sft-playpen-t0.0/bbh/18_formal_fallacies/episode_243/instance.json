  "input": "\"Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, Clyde is a half-brother of Darrin or a grandson of Bryan. Moreover, not being a stepbrother of Fred is sufficient for being a half-brother of Darrin and a grandson of Bryan. It follows that it is false that Clyde is a stepbrother of Fred.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid",
