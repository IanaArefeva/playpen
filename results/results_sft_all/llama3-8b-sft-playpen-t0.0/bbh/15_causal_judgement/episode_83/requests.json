The plan involves a 5 am start, a 3.5 hour drive, and a 1.5 hour rest stop along the way. The plan is carefully followed, and you end up in the nearby city exactly on time. A weather forecast before you left indicated that there would be a 5 am fog bank in your hometown, which would clear by the time you reached the nearby city. The fog bank was so thick that you could not have made the trip without it. In your mind, you attribute the fog bank's clearing to the weather forecast you saw before you left.
