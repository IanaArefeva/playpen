Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior was due to his generosity. Joe is the type of person who wants to do good things for others in need. Sometimes his friends are bothered by his seemingly excessive generosity and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized his generosity was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard.
