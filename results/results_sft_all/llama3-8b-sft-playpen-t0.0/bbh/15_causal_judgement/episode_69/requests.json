Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: No\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nSuzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: \"Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time.\" Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nGeorge and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nTodd, Anne, Jason, and Steph all share an account for a popular online television streaming service. In addition to keeping the account constantly logged in on their TV, they also use the same account on their laptops. Because the provider of this streaming service wants to increase the amount of active accounts in order to increase profits, they have begun to monitor the number of devices using a single account at once. Given that the account is always logged in on their TV, the streaming service will suspend their account if three people log into the account from their laptops at the same time. Todd, Anne, and Jason regularly use their account from their laptops on Saturdays. This Saturday, as usual, Todd logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Just then, Anne also logged into their account from her laptop, and Jason also logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Sure enough, since three people logged into the streaming account at the same time, the account was suspended.
