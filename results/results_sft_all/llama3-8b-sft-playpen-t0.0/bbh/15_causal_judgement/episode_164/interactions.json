The grid is filled with X's except for the middle column, which is empty. The grid is then folded along the vertical line of X's, creating a symmetrical pattern. The folded grid is then placed on a table, and a book is placed on top of it. The book is so heavy that it warps the grid, creating a new pattern of X's and empty cells.
