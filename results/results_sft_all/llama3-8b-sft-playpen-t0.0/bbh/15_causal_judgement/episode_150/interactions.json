Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nA group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. The students cheated on the test. One student, John Granger, did not go along with the group. Granger deviates from the local norm and refuses to cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B and, as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points. Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA:",

The grid is filled with X's and ▢'s in a pattern that looks like a cross. The child is then given a blank grid and is asked to place an X in the center of the grid. The child places the X in the center of the grid, and the grid now looks like a cross. The child then places an X in the top center of the grid, and the grid now looks like a cross with an additional X in the top center. The child then places an X in the bottom center of the grid, and the grid now looks like a cross with additional X's in the top center and bottom center. Finally, the child places an X in the middle of the right column, and the grid now looks like a cross with additional X's in the top center, bottom center, and middle of the right column. The grid now looks like a cross with additional X's in the top center, bottom center, and middle of the right column.
