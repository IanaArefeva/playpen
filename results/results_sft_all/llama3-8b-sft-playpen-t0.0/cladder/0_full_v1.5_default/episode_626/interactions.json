The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 45%. The probability of high school degree or lower and high salary is 27%. The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 42%. Is the chance of high salary larger when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the relationship between college degree and high salary is not entirely causal, as the unobserved confounder could be driving both the higher education level and the higher salary. In this case, the observed relationship between college degree and high salary is likely due to the unobserved confounder rather than a direct causal link.||",
