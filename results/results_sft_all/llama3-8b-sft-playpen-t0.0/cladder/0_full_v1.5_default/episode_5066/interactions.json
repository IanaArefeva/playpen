The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how having a sister correlates with cholesterol level case by case according to unobserved confounders. Method 2: We look directly at how having a sister correlates with cholesterol level in general. To understand how having a sister affects cholesterol level, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Method 1 involves looking at the relationship case by case, which could lead to bias from unobserved confounders, making it less reliable than the direct measure in Method 2.||",
