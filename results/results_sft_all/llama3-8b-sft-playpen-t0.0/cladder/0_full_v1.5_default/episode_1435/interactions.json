The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 55%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 43%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of clean water is 12%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of clean water is 65%. Will clean water decrease the chance of cholera contraction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key point here is that the water company type (local vs. global) has a direct effect on water quality, which in turn affects the risk of cholera. Since the water company type is exogenous to the relationship between water quality and cholera, we can conclude that clean water will decrease the chance of cholera contraction.||",
