The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 49%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 84%. For children with intelligent parents, would it be less likely to see intelligent child if the child had unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the parents' intelligence has a positive effect on the child's intelligence. If we condition on the child having intelligent parents, we are already in a state where the child is more likely to be intelligent. The parents' social status, which is also higher in this condition, further increases the likelihood of the child being intelligent. In this scenario, the child's parents are already intelligent, so the parents' social status is not the primary driver of the child's intelligence. The parents' intelligence is the key factor that directly affects the child's intelligence, and this effect is not diminished by the child having parents with a lower social status.||",
