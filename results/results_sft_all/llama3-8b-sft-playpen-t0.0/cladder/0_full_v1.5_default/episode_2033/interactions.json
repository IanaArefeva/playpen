The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 94%. For students who are not talented, the probability of being hard-working is 83%. For students who are talented, the probability of being hard-working is 83%. Is being hard-working less likely than being lazy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of being talented is 94%, the overall probability of being hard-working is also 94% (0.94 * 0.83 + 0.06 * 0.83 = 0.83). The probability of being lazy is 1 - 0.83 = 0.17.
