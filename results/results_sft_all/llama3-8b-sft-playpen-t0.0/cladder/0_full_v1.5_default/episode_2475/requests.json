The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 90%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 79%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 13%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 0%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 40%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the treatment does not make a difference for patients with large kidney stones, and the only thing that matters is whether the kidney stone is large or small. Since the probability of large kidney stone is 40%, the overall probability of recovery for patients who have large kidney stones is 0%, and the probability of large kidney stone is higher than the probability of small kidney stone, the treatment does not make a difference in the overall probability of recovery.<|eot_id|>",
