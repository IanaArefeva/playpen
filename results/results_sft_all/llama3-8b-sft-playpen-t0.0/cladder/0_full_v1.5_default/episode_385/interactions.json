The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and penguin survival. Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are sad, the probability of penguin death is 28%. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are happy, the probability of penguin death is 60%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are sad, the probability of penguin death is 35%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are happy, the probability of penguin death is 74%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin happiness is 57%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin happiness is 22%. Does my decision negatively affect penguin survival through penguin mood?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between my decision and penguin mood is that my decision to take the stairs or the elevator affects the probability of penguin happiness, but this does not directly lead to a higher probability of penguin death. The negative effect on penguin survival is primarily due to the direct relationship between penguin mood and penguin death, where sad penguins have a higher probability of death than happy penguins. My decision does not directly increase the probability of penguin death; rather, it affects the mood of the penguin, which in turn affects the probability of death.||",
