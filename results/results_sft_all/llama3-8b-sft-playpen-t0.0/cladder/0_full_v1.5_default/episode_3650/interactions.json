The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drug taken and freckles. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on drug taken. Drug taken has a direct effect on freckles. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of freckles is 59%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of freckles is 67%. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 26%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 69%. Will taking of all assigned drugs increase the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of treatment assignment on drug taken is positive, meaning that being assigned the drug treatment is associated with a higher probability of taking the drug.
