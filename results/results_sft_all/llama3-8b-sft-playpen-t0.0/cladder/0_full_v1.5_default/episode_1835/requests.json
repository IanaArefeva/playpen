Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of vaccination is 10%. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 41%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 42%. Is smallpox survival less likely than smallpox death overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between smallpox and smallpox survival is that the probability of smallpox survival is higher for those who get smallpox than for those who do not (42% vs 0). The direct relationship between vaccination reaction and smallpox survival is that the probability of smallpox survival is higher for those who have a positive vaccination reaction than for those who do not (42% vs 0). The direct relationship between smallpox and smallpox death is that the probability of smallpox death is higher for those who get smallpox than for those who do not (58% vs 0). The direct relationship between vaccination and smallpox death is that the probability of smallpox death is lower for those who are vaccinated than for those who are not (58% vs 58%). The direct relationship between vaccination reaction and smallpox death is that the probability of smallpox death is lower for those who have a positive vaccination reaction than for those who do not (58% vs 58%).<|eot_id|>",
