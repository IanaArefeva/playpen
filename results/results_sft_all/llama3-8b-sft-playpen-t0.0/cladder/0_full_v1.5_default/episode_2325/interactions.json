The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 94%. The probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 3%. The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 64%. Is the chance of long lifespan larger when observing obesity?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we're not directly observing the effect of smoking, we need to consider its indirect effect through diabetes. The direct effect of diabetes on lifespan is also negative. In this chain of effects, the positive direct effect of obesity on long lifespan is counteracted by the negative direct and indirect effects of diabetes (caused by both obesity and smoking) on long lifespan. This balance of positive and negative effects means that the chance of long lifespan is not larger when observing obesity.||",
