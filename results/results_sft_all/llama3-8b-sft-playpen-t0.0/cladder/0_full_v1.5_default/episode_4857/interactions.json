The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of high rainfall is 43%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of high rainfall is 76%. Will waking up late increase the chance of high rainfall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The question also involves the relationship between Alice's wake-up time and the probability of high rainfall, which is further influenced by the direct relationship between traffic and the probability of high rainfall. In this world, the probability of high rainfall is not only determined by Alice's wake-up time, but also by the state of the road condition (traffic), which is not directly related to Alice's wake-up time. The correct answer is \"No\" since the direct relationship between Alice's wake-up time and the probability of high rainfall is not the only factor at play here, and the additional relationship between the state of the road condition (traffic) and the probability of high rainfall needs to be considered.||",
