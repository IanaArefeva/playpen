  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 1%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 10%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 70%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 75%. The overall probability of old age is 44%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?",
