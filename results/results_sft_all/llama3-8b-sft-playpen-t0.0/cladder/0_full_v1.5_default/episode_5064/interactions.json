The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 35%. For patients who do not have a sister, the probability of low cholesterol is 73%. For patients who have a sister, the probability of low cholesterol is 29%. Is low cholesterol more likely than high cholesterol overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of having a sister is 35%, and the probability of having a sister and also having lower cholesterol is 29%, we can conclude that the overall probability of having lower cholesterol is less than the probability of having higher cholesterol.||",
