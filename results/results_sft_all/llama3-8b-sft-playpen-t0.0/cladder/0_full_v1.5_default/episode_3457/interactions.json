The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For situations where there is no solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 39%. For situations where there is a solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 4%. Will solar eclipse increase the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the solar eclipse directly counteracts the positive effect of not having a solar eclipse, which is a 39% chance of arriving on time. In the absence of a solar eclipse, the probability of Alice arriving on time is 39%, which is higher than the 4% chance when a solar eclipse occurs. This indicates that the solar eclipse has a negative effect on Alice's arrival time, rather than increasing the chance of arriving on time.||",
