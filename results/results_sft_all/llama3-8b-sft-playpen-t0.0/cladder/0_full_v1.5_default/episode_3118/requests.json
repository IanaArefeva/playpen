The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active and high cigarette tax causes smoking mother. confounder active and smoking mother causes normal infant birth weight. We observed the cigarette tax is low and confounder inactive. Would the infant is born with a normal weight if smoking mother instead of nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The confounder is active and has a direct effect on both the maternal smoking status and the infant's birth weight. Since we are conditionally focusing on the case where the cigarette tax is low and the confounder is inactive, we must consider the potential impact of the unobserved confounder. If the unobserved confounder is active, it would still directly influence the infant's birth weight, leading to a normal birth weight, independent of the maternal smoking status.<|eot_id|>",
