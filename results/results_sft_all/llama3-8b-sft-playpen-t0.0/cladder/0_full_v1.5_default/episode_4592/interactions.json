The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 81%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 18%. For people who have a brother, would it be less likely to see ringing alarm if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between having a brother and the probability of the alarm clock ringing is also subject to the intervening effect of the person's wife. In this world, having a brother has a direct effect on the person's wife, and the person's wife has a direct effect on the alarm clock. This means that the relationship between having a brother and the probability of the alarm clock ringing is not direct, but rather is mediated by the person's wife. Since the person's wife is not directly related to the probability of the alarm clock ringing in the absence of a brother, the probability of the alarm clock ringing in the absence of a brother is still 81%.||",
