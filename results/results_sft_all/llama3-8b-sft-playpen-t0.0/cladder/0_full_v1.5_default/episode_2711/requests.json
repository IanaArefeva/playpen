The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 82%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 6%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 60%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer given smoking is 60%, which is higher than the probability of lung cancer given nonsmoking (6%). This suggests that the presence of smoking actually increases the likelihood of lung cancer, rather than decreasing it.<|eot_id|>",
