The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 59%. The probability of not taking medication and healthy heart is 10%. The probability of taking medication and healthy heart is 22%. Is the chance of healthy heart smaller when observing taking medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is that higher blood pressure is associated with a higher risk of heart condition. The probability of taking medication is 59%, and the probability of not taking medication and having a healthy heart is 10%. The probability of taking medication and having a healthy heart is 22%. The key point here is that the direct relationship between medication and heart condition is positive, meaning that medication helps reduce the risk of heart condition. The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is also positive, meaning that higher blood pressure is associated with a higher risk of heart condition. Since the probability of taking medication and having a healthy heart is higher than the probability of not taking medication and having a healthy heart, this suggests that medication is associated with a lower risk of heart condition. Therefore, the chance of having a healthy heart is not smaller when observing taking medication; rather, it is likely larger.||",
