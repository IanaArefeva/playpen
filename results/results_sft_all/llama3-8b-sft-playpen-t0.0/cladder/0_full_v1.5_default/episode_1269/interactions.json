The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 19%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 71%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 25%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 57%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 26%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. The overall probability of smoking is 38%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with no tar deposit is 25%, which is higher than the probability of lung cancer among smokers with no tar deposit (26%). This suggests that the absence of tar deposit may be a more significant risk factor for lung cancer than smoking. Additionally, the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with high tar deposit (57%) is higher than the probability of lung cancer among smokers with high tar deposit (58%). This further indicates that the relationship between tar deposit and lung cancer is more direct than the relationship between smoking and lung cancer.||",
