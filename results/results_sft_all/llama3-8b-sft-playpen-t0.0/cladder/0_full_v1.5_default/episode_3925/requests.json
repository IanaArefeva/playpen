Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 31%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 65%. Will having visited England decrease the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high salary is higher for those who have visited England (65%) than for those who have not (31%). This suggests that having visited England has a positive effect on salary, which in turn could lead to higher occupation levels. Since occupation has a direct effect on salary, this chain of causality could result in higher salaries for those who have visited England.<|eot_id|>",
