The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 55%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 87%. Will college degree or higher decrease the chance of black hair?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since college degree directly affects skill, and skill in turn affects black hair, we need to consider the joint effect of college degree and skill on black hair. The given information shows that college degree directly leads to a higher probability of black hair (87% vs 55%). This suggests that college degree has a positive effect on black hair, rather than a negative one.||",
