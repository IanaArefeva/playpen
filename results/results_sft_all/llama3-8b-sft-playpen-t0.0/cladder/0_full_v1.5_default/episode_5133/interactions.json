The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of large feet is 40%. For people living close to a college, the probability of large feet is 51%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 78%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 37%. Will college degree or higher decrease the chance of large feet?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both education level and foot size, we must consider their influence when examining the relationship between college degree or higher and large feet. The observed differences in foot size between those living far and close to a college (40% vs. 51%) likely stem from the unobserved confounders rather than the college degree itself. In this context, college degree or higher does not directly reduce the chance of large feet; rather, the unobserved confounders play a role in both educational attainment and foot size.||",
