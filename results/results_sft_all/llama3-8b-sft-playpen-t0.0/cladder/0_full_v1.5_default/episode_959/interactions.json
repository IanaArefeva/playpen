The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 19%. The probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 68%. The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 15%. Is the chance of long lifespan larger when observing obesity?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 15%, which is lower than the probability of normal weight and long lifespan (68%). This suggests that there might be a negative relationship between obesity and long lifespan. The direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan is also not clear, as the direct effect of smoking on long lifespan is not quantified. The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is also not clear, as the direct effect of diabetes on long lifespan is not quantified. The only clear direct relationship is between diabetes and long lifespan, which is a negative relationship.
