The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 59%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 29%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 33%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 4%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 74%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 72%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 45%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 26%. The overall probability of confounder active is 42%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would parents' intelligence negatively affect lactose intolerance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of being lactose intolerant is different across various groups of children, but we do not have direct evidence of a negative relationship between parents' intelligence and children's lactose intolerance. The different probabilities of being lactose intolerant across different groups of children are likely due to the direct and indirect effects of parents' social status and the unobserved confounder.||",
