Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 90%. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 67%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 55%.

Since the probability of smoking is 90%, the overall probability of college admission can be calculated as follows: (0.1) * (0.55) + (0.9) * (0.67) = 0.055 + 0.603 = 0.658. The probability of college rejection is 1 - 0.658 = 0.342. Since 0.658 is less than 0.5, college admission is less likely than college rejection overall.<|eot_id|>",
