The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 66%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 18%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 53%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 31%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 51%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 29%. The overall probability of smoking is 41%. Does smoking positively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not positive; in fact, the probability of lung cancer is lower for smokers than for nonsmokers in both the no tar and high tar scenarios. The positive relationship between smoking and lung cancer is only through the intermediate variable of tar deposit, which is not a direct cause of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
