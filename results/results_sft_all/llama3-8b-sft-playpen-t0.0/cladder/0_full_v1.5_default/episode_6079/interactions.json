The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. We know that being able to swim causes lack of studying. being able to swim or studying hard causes high exam score. Would the student has a high exam score if not being able to swim instead of being able to swim?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since being able to swim causes a lack of studying, and studying habits have a direct effect on exam score, we can conclude that being able to swim would lead to a lower exam score. If the student is not being able to swim, then we can rule out the direct negative effect of being able to swim on exam score. In that case, the only remaining direct cause of exam score is studying habits, and we know that studying habits lead to a high exam score. Therefore, if the student is not being able to swim, we can conclude that they would have a high exam score.||",
