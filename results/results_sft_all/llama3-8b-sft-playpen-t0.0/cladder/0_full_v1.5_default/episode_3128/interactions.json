The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. We know that high poverty and global water company causes clean water. high poverty and clean water causes cholera contraction. We observed the person is served by a local water company and the region has high poverty. Would the person avoids cholera if clean water instead of polluted water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the person is in a region with high poverty, we can conclude that the person is likely to have clean water. The direct relationship between water quality and cholera means that clean water would reduce the risk of cholera. Additionally, the direct relationship between clean water and cholera contraction means that if the person has clean water, they are more likely to contract cholera. This suggests that the person's risk of cholera is higher if they have clean water, which is counterintuitive.||",
