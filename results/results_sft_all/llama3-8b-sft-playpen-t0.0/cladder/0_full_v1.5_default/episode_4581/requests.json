Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 82%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 24%. For people who have a brother, would it be more likely to see ringing alarm if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is lower for people who have a brother (24%) compared to those who do not have a brother (82%). This directly indicates that having a brother is associated with a lower likelihood of the alarm clock ringing. The additional condition of the person not having a brother does not change this relationship; the person still has a brother, and the lower probability of the alarm clock ringing remains.<|eot_id|>",
