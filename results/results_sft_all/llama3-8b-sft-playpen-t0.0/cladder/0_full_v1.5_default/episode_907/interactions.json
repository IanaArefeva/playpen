The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. Method 1: We look at how smoking correlates with college admission case by case according to effort. Method 2: We look directly at how smoking correlates with college admission in general. To understand how smoking affects college admission, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between smoking and college admission is also mediated by the intervening variable of \"effort\". In other words, the effect of smoking on college admission is not direct, but rather indirect through its effect on effort. \n\nIn this case, looking at the direct relationship between smoking and college admission (Method 2) would not account for the intervening variable of \"effort\" and might lead to a biased or incomplete understanding of the relationship between smoking and college admission. \n\nOn the other hand, looking at the relationship between smoking and college admission case by case according to \"effort\" (Method 1) would control for the intervening variable of \"effort\" and provide a more accurate picture of the relationship between smoking and college admission. This is because it would account for the different levels of \"effort\" among the study participants and how they are associated with both \"smoking\" and \"college admission\".||",
