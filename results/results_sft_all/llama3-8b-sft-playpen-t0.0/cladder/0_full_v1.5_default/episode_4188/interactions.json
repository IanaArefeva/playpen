The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 8%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 26%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 84%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 99%. The overall probability of male gender is 53%. Will having a brother decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of male gender is 53%, this means that a larger fraction of the total patient pool is male and has a brother than is female and has a brother. The higher probability of male patients having a brother and the higher probability of male patients recovering (84% for those without a brother and 99% for those with a brother) indicate that having a brother is associated with higher recovery rates, not lower ones.||",
