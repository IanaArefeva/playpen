The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 63%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 43%. For infants who have a sister, would it be less likely to see high infant mortality if the infant did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The birth weight of the infant is also directly related to both having a sister and lower infant mortality, which further solidifies the positive effect of having a sister on infant health. The health condition of the infant is unobserved, but its direct relationship with both birth weight and infant mortality is established. The birth weight of the infant, in turn, directly affects the probability of high infant mortality. Since the birth weight of the infant is already accounted for in the direct relationship between having a sister and lower infant mortality, the absence of a sister would not lead to a lower probability of high infant mortality in this specific context.<|eot_id|>",
