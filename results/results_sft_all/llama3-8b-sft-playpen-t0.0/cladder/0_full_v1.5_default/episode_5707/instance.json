Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 63%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 43%. For infants who have a sister, would it be less likely to see high infant mortality if the infant did not have a sister?",
