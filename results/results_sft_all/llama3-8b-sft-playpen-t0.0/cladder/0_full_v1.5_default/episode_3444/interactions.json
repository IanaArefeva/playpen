The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For situations where there is no solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 81%. For situations where there is a solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 48%. Will solar eclipse decrease the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
