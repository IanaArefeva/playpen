Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. We know that smoking causes absence of tar deposit, and we know that high tar deposit causes lung cancer.

Since we are given that the person is a smoker, we can conclude that they have a high degree of tar deposit. This, in turn, directly leads to lung cancer. The absence of tar deposit is not a condition that can be achieved by not smoking; rather, it is a condition that is directly opposite to the state of being a smoker. Therefore, if the person were a nonsmoker, they would still have a high degree of tar deposit, and this would lead to lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
