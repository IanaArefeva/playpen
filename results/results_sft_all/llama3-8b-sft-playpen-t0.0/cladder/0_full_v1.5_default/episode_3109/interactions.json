The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. We know that smoking causes absence of tar deposit, and we know that high tar deposit causes lung cancer. Would the person has lung cancer if nonsmoking instead of smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we are given that the person is a smoker, we can conclude that they have a high degree of tar deposit. This, in turn, directly leads to lung cancer. The absence of tar deposit is not a condition that can be achieved by not smoking; rather, it is a condition that is directly opposite to the state of being a smoker. Therefore, if the person were a nonsmoker, they would still have a high degree of tar deposit, and this would lead to lung cancer.||",
