The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and brown eyes. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on brown eyes. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 29%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and brown eyes is 41%. The probability of smoking mother and brown eyes is 3%. Is the chance of brown eyes larger when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is confirmed by the given data: the probability of brown eyes is 3% when the mother smokes and 41% when the mother does not smoke. The direct relationship between unobserved confounders and brown eyes is also positive, meaning that the probability of brown eyes is higher when the unobserved confounders are present. The direct relationship between unobserved confounders and maternal smoking status is also positive, meaning that the probability of the mother smoking is higher when the unobserved confounders are present. The direct relationship between cigarette tax and maternal smoking status is negative, meaning that the probability of the mother smoking is lower when the cigarette tax is higher. The overall probability of brown eyes is 41%, which is higher than the probability of brown eyes when the mother smokes (3%). This suggests that the positive direct relationship between unobserved confounders and brown eyes is more influential than the positive direct relationship between maternal smoking status and brown eyes.||",
