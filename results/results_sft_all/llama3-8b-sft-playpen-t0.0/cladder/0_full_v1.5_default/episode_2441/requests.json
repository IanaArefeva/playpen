The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 55%. For patients who pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 25%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 59%. Is recovery less likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since hospital costs have a direct positive effect on recovery, and the probability of a high hospital bill is 55%, we can conclude that the overall probability of recovery is higher than that of non-recovery.<|eot_id|>",
