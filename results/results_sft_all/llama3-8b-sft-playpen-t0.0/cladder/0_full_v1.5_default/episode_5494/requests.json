Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 68%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 49%. Will citrus intake increase the chance of curly hair?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key point here is that the probability of curly hair is higher (68%) for patients not consuming citrus compared to those who do consume citrus (49%). This suggests that citrus consumption actually decreases the chance of curly hair, rather than increasing it.<|eot_id|>",
