The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 51%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 18%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 34%. Is the chance of intelligent child smaller when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The additional unobserved direct effect of other unobserved factors on child's intelligence is also already accounted for in the joint probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child (34%). The joint probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is higher than the probability of intelligent parents (51%) and the probability of intelligent child (not directly given, but can be derived from the other probabilities), which suggests that the direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is not the only factor determining child's intelligence. The joint probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is also higher than the probability of intelligent child (not directly given, but can be derived from the other probabilities), which further suggests that the direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is not the only factor determining child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
