Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, it might appear that smoking directly affects lung cancer. However, the correct chain of causality is: Smoking → Tar deposit → Lung cancer. The increase in the probability of lung cancer among smokers is entirely due to the higher probability of tar deposit among smokers, which in turn directly affects the probability of lung cancer. This chain of causality shows that the increase in the probability of lung cancer among smokers is not a direct result of smoking but rather an indirect result of the higher probability of tar deposit among smokers.<|eot_id|>",
