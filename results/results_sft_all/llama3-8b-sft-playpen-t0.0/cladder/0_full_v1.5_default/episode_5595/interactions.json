The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 55%. The probability of low hospital bill and thick lips is 11%. The probability of high hospital bill and thick lips is 32%. Is the chance of thick lips smaller when observing high hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The joint probability of thick lips and high hospital bill is 32%, which is higher than the individual probability of thick lips (not directly given, but can be derived from the joint probability of thick lips and high hospital bill, and the individual probability of high hospital bill). This suggests that the chance of thick lips is not smaller when observing high hospital bill, but rather that the two are associated through their common cause, hospital costs.||",
