Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 22%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key point here is that the person in question is already a smoker, so we're looking at the relationship between being a smoker and the risk of lung cancer, rather than the relationship between being a nonsmoker and the risk of lung cancer. Since the person is already a smoker, their risk of lung cancer is already higher than that of a nonsmoker, and being a nonsmoker would not increase their risk further.<|eot_id|>",
