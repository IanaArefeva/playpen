The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 37%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 43%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of smoke is 37%, and the probability of lung cancer among smoke is 43%, the overall probability of lung cancer is less than 37% (0.37 * 0.43 = 0.1591) which is less than the probability of absence of lung cancer (1 - 0.1591 = 0.8409).<|eot_id|>",
