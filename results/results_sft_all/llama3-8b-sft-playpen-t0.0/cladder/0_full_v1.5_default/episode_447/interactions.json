The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 57%. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 46%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 88%. Is healthy heart less likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a person having a heart condition is 1 - 0.88 = 0.12 when they take medication and 1 - 0.46 = 0.54 when they do not take medication. The overall probability of a person having a heart condition is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is (0.57 * 0.12) + (0.43 * 0.54) = 0.26. The probability of a person having a heart condition is less than the probability of a person having a heart condition when they do not take medication (0.26  0.54), and it is also less than the probability of a person having a heart condition when they take medication (0.26  0.12), which is the opposite of what we want to conclude.||",
