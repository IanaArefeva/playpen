The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 86%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 31%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 70%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that in 0.86 * 0.70 = 0.602 of the cases, both the manager and the employee will be involved in the firing process. In the remaining 0.14 of the cases, the manager will not sign the letter, and the probability of the employee being fired is 0.31. This leads to a total probability of the employee being fired of 0.602 * 0.70 + 0.14 * 0.31 = 0.4223. In the remaining 0.577 of the cases, the manager will not sign the letter, and the probability of the employee not being fired is 1 - 0.31 = 0.69. This leads to a total probability of the employee not being fired of 0.577 * 0.69 = 0.3993. Since 0.4223  0.3993, the probability of the employee being fired is higher than the probability of the employee not being fired.||",
