The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of full moon is 20%. The probability of no full moon and wet ground is 26%. The probability of full moon and wet ground is 9%. Is the chance of wet ground larger when observing full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of no full moon and wet ground is higher than the probability of full moon and wet ground, this suggests that the direct effect of weather on ground is more influential than the direct effect of full moon on weather. In other words, the weather condition is more likely to lead to a wet ground than the full moon condition.<|eot_id|>",
