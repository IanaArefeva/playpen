The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 69%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 54%. Does smoking negatively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer is higher for nonsmokers than for smokers, which suggests that the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is negative. The higher probability of lung cancer in nonsmokers likely indicates that there are other risk factors or confounding variables not accounted for in this isolated system.||",
