The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a brother and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Having a brother has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how having a brother correlates with infant's birth weight in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to unobserved confounders. To understand how having a brother affects infant's birth weight, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the relationship between having a brother and infant's birth weight is likely to be confounded by the unobserved confounders. In such a case, looking at the general correlation between having a brother and infant's birth weight (Method 1) would likely lead to a spurious positive association, as both variables are being influenced by the same unobserved confounders. In contrast, looking at this relationship case by case according to the unobserved confounders (Method 2) would help control for the confounding effect and provide a more accurate picture of the relationship between having a brother and infant's birth weight.<|eot_id|>",
