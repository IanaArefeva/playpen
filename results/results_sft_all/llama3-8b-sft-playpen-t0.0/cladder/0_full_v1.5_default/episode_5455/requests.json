Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of playing card games is 96%. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 36%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 58%.

The probability of long lifespan is higher for card game players (58%) than for non-card game players (36%). Since the probability of card game play is 96%, the overall probability of long lifespan is likely to be higher than the probability of short lifespan, which is 4% (100% - 96%).<|eot_id|>",
