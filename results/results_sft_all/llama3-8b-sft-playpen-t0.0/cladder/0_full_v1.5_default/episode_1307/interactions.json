The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 34%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 70%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 62%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 19%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. The overall probability of smoking is 29%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is higher than among nonsmokers only when there is a high tar deposit. In the absence of a high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than among nonsmokers. This suggests that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not direct but rather mediated by the presence of a high tar deposit. Since the probability of a high tar deposit is higher among smokers than among nonsmokers, the overall effect of smoking on lung cancer is still positive, but it is not as strong as it might appear at first glance.||",
