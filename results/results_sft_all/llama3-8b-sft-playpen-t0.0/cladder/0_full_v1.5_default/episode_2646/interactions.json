The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 79%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 40%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer for smokers is already higher than for nonsmokers, and this difference is not further magnified by the presence of a high tar deposit. In fact, the probability of lung cancer for smokers with a high tar deposit is lower than for nonsmokers with a high tar deposit (40% vs 49%). This suggests that the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is already fully captured by the given probabilities, and that the additional information about the person's past behavior as a nonsmoker does not provide any further insight into their current risk of lung cancer.||",
