Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 68%. For smokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 31%. Will smoking decrease the chance of being lactose intolerant?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that smoking might reduce the chance of being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
