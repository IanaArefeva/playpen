The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of having a sister is 88%. The probability of not having a sister and lung cancer is 7%. The probability of having a sister and lung cancer is 25%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
