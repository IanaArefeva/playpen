The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 59%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 59%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 82%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 83%. Will increased supply increase the chance of increased price?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of an increased price is the same for both scenarios of yield per acre (59% for both), which might imply that demand is the primary driver of price movements. Since demand is unobserved and its direct relationship with price is not accounted for, we cannot conclude that an increase in supply will lead to an increase in the chance of an increased price.||",
