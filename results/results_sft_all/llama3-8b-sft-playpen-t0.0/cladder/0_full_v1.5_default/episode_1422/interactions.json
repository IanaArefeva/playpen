The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 45%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 58%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 63%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 27%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of normal birth weight is higher in areas with high cigarette tax (58%) than in areas with low cigarette tax (45%). This suggests that the cigarette tax has a positive effect on birth weight, likely through its effect on maternal smoking behavior. Since the probability of a smoking mother is lower in areas with high cigarette tax (27%) than in areas with low cigarette tax (63%), it is likely that the positive effect of the cigarette tax on birth weight is not fully offset by the direct negative effect of maternal smoking.||",
