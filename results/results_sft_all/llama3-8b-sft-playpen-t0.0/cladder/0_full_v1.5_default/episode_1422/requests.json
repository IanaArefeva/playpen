The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 45%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 58%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 63%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 27%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of normal birth weight is higher in areas with high cigarette tax (58%) than in areas with low cigarette tax (45%). This suggests that the cigarette tax has a positive effect on birth weight, likely through its effect on maternal smoking behavior. Since the probability of a smoking mother is lower in areas with high cigarette tax (27%) than in areas with low cigarette tax (63%), it is likely that the positive effect of the cigarette tax on birth weight is not fully offset by the direct negative effect of maternal smoking.<|eot_id|>",
