The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of solar eclipse is 42%. For situations where there is no solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 62%. For situations where there is a solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 31%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that in 42% of the scenarios, Alice is likely to be late. In the remaining 58% of the scenarios (where there is no solar eclipse), the probability of arriving to school on time is 62%. Since 31% is less than 62%, and 42% of the scenarios involve being late, the overall probability of being late is higher than the overall probability of being on time.||",
