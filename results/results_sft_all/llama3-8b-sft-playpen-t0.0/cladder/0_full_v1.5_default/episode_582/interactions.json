The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 42%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 69%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be more likely to see high salary if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This indicates that having a college degree or higher directly leads to a higher likelihood of having a high salary. If we consider a person with a college degree or higher and then remove their college degree, we are left with a person who still has a college degree or higher but now lacks the educational background that typically comes with it. In this scenario, the person's educational background is still higher than that of someone without a college degree, which means their likelihood of having a high salary remains higher than that of someone without a college degree.||",
