The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 15%. For people not blowing out candles, the probability of dark room is 83%. For people who blow out candles, the probability of dark room is 49%. Is dark room more likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
