The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 42%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 55%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of smoking is 42%, this means that more than half of the population is at higher risk of lung cancer. In a world where the only direct relationships are between smoke, lung cancer, and the unobserved gender, we can conclude that the overall probability of lung cancer is less than the probability of its absence, given that the higher risk of lung cancer is concentrated in the subpopulation that makes up more than half of the total population.<|eot_id|>",
