The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of the captain's order to execute the prisoner is 69%. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 23%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 64%. Is the prisoner's death less likely than the prisoner being alive overall?",
