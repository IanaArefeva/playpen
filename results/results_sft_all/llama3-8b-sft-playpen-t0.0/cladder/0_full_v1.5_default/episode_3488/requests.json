Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 8%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 30%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 84%. Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of going to the beach on foot size is that it also makes large feet more likely. The probability of large feet for people not using tanning salon treatments is 30%. The probability of large feet for the general population is a weighted average of the two groups: (0.08 * 0.84) + (0.92 * 0.30) = 0.0672 + 0.276 = 0.3432. The probability of small feet is 1 - 0.3432 = 0.6568. Since 0.6568 is greater than 0.3432, large feet are not more likely than small feet overall.<|eot_id|>",
