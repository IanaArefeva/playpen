Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. We know that old age causes high hospital bill. old age and high hospital bill causes recovery. We observed the patient is old.

Since we already know that the patient is old and that old age leads to high hospital costs, we can conclude that the patient will have high hospital costs. With high hospital costs, the patient is likely to recover. If we were to change the hospital costs to a low hospital bill, we would be breaking the direct relationship between hospital costs and recovery, which is that high hospital costs lead to a higher chance of recovery. In this new scenario, we would need additional information about the patient's condition and the hospital's practices to conclude whether the patient would still recover.<|eot_id|>",
