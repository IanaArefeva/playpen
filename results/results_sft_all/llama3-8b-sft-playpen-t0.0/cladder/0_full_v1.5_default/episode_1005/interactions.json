The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 84%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 47%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 15%. Is scurvy less likely than no scurvy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of citrus consumption is 84%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction to get the overall probability of scurvy: (0.84) * (0.15) + (0.16) * (0.47) = 0.1234 + 0.0752 = 0.1986. The probability of no scurvy is 1 - 0.1986 = 0.8014. Since 0.8014 is greater than 0.1986, scurvy is less likely than no scurvy overall.||",
