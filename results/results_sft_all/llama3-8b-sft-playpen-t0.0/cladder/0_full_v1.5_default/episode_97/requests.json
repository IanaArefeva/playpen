The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 21%. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 64%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 63%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 99%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 60%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 64%. For managers who sign termination letters, would it be more likely to see employee being fired if the manager had signed the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
