Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 51%. For people refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 77%. For people getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 37%.

The key insight here is that the probability of recovering from the disease is higher for those who refuse the vaccine (77%) than for those who get the vaccine (37%). This suggests that the vaccine is not particularly effective in preventing death from the disease, and that those who get the vaccine are more likely to die from the disease than those who refuse it.\nHowever, we also need to consider the overall probability of getting the vaccine, which is 51%. This means that more than half of the population will get the vaccine, and the remaining half will refuse it. Since the probability of recovering from the disease is higher for those who refuse the vaccine, we can conclude that the overall probability of recovering from the disease is higher than the probability of dying from the disease.\nTo formalize this argument, we can use the following calculations:\n- The probability of getting the vaccine is 0.51, and the probability of recovering from the disease given that the vaccine is taken is 0.37. This means that the probability of both getting the vaccine and recovering from the disease is 0.51 \\* 0.37 = 0.1893.\n- The probability of not getting the vaccine is 1 - 0.51 = 0.49, and the probability of recovering from the disease given that the vaccine is not taken is 0.77.",
