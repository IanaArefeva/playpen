The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 3%. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 50%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 50%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 97%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 63%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 84%. Does husband negatively affect alarm clock through wife?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The wife's action of setting the alarm also directly affects the probability of the alarm ringing, separate from the husband's action. The husband's action of not setting the alarm still has a direct effect on the probability of the alarm ringing, which is different from the case when the husband sets the alarm. The wife's action of setting the alarm when the husband doesn't set it still has a direct effect on the probability of the alarm ringing, which is different from the case when the husband sets the alarm. The direct relationships between the husband, the wife, and the alarm clock are separate and distinct, and there is no evidence of a negative effect of the husband on the alarm clock through the wife.||",
