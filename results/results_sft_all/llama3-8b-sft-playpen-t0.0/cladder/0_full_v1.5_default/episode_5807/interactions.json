The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not have a brother and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For people who do not have a brother and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 31%. For people who have a brother and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 69%. For people who have a brother and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 32%. For people who do not have a brother and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 62%. For people who do not have a brother and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 34%. For people who have a brother and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 31%. For people who have a brother and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 9%. The overall probability of high pollution is 44%. Does having a brother positively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key insight here is that the probability of lung cancer is higher for those who have a brother and smoke than for those who do not have a brother and smoke (32% vs. 31%). This suggests that having a brother may increase the likelihood of smoking, which in turn increases the likelihood of lung cancer.||",
