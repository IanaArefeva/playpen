Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that waking up late and heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is no traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school late if waking up late instead of waking up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we are told there is no traffic on the road, the condition of no traffic does not directly influence Alice's arrival time. The condition of Alice waking up late would still lead to a late arrival at school, but this is independent of the condition of no traffic.<|eot_id|>",
