The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 76%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 43%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 86%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 51%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In particular, the probability of lung cancer for smokers with no tar deposit is 76%, which is only 1% higher than the probability of lung cancer for nonsmokers with no tar deposit (77%). In contrast, the probability of lung cancer for smokers with high tar deposit is 43%, which is 1% lower than the probability of lung cancer for nonsmokers with high tar deposit (42%). This suggests that the positive effect of smoking on lung cancer is offset by the negative effect of the associated high tar deposit. Since the person is a smoker, we can conclude that the probability of lung cancer is higher if they had been a nonsmoker, primarily because the associated high tar deposit would lead to a lower probability of lung cancer.||",
