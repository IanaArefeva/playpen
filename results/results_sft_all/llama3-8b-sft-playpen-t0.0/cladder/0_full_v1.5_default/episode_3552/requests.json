Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of having a brother is 75%. The probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival is 11%. The probability of having a brother and smallpox survival is 40%.

The probability of having a brother and smallpox survival is 40%, which is lower than the probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival (11%).\n2. The direct effect of having a brother on smallpox survival is not clear from the given information. The direct effect of having a brother is on vaccination reaction, and the direct effect of vaccination reaction is on smallpox survival.\n3. The direct effect of having a brother on smallpox survival is not isolated from the direct effect of not having a brother on smallpox survival. The probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival is 11%, which is lower than the probability of having a brother and smallpox survival (40%).\n4. The overall probability of having a brother is 75%, which means that 25% of the population does not have a brother. The probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival is 11%, which is lower than the probability of having a brother and smallpox survival (40%).\n5. The direct effect of having a brother on smallpox survival is not isolated from the direct effect of not having a brother on smallpox survival.
