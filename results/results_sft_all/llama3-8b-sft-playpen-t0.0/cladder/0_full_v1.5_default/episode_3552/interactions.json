The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of having a brother is 75%. The probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival is 11%. The probability of having a brother and smallpox survival is 40%. Is the chance of smallpox survival larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having a brother and smallpox survival is 40%, which is lower than the probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival (11%).\n2. The direct effect of having a brother on smallpox survival is not clear from the given information. The direct effect of having a brother is on vaccination reaction, and the direct effect of vaccination reaction is on smallpox survival.\n3. The direct effect of having a brother on smallpox survival is not isolated from the direct effect of not having a brother on smallpox survival. The probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival is 11%, which is lower than the probability of having a brother and smallpox survival (40%).\n4. The overall probability of having a brother is 75%, which means that 25% of the population does not have a brother. The probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival is 11%, which is lower than the probability of having a brother and smallpox survival (40%).\n5.
