Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. We know that speaking english and smoker causes having diabetes. speaking english and smoker and having diabetes causes long lifespan. We observed the person is a smoker.

Since the person has diabetes, we can conclude that they have a short lifespan. The ability to speak English does not directly affect the person's diabetes or lifespan, as the direct effects of speaking English are on diabetes and lifespan through the intermediate variable of having diabetes, which is already present in this person. The person's short lifespan is primarily due to their diabetes, which is a direct result of their smoking habits.<|eot_id|>",
