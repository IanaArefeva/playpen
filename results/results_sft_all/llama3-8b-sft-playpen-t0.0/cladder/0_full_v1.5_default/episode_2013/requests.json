The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 41%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 59%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 49%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 9%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of college degree or higher on high salary is not isolated from the effects of the unobserved confounders and the distance to the college. The probability of high salary is higher for those living close to a college (59%) than for those living far from a college (41%), which suggests that the distance to the college has a direct effect on the probability of high salary. The probability of college degree or higher is lower for those living close to a college (9%) than for those living far from a college (49%), which suggests that the distance to the college has a direct effect on the probability of college degree or higher. The unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both the probability of college degree or higher and the probability of high salary. Since the distance to the college has a direct effect on both the probability of college degree or higher and the probability of high salary, and the unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both the probability of college degree or higher and the probability of high salary, we cannot conclude that college degree or higher will increase the chance of high salary.<|eot_id|>",
