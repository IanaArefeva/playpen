  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 54%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 92%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 39%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 67%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 32%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. The overall probability of smoking is 14%. Does smoking positively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?",
