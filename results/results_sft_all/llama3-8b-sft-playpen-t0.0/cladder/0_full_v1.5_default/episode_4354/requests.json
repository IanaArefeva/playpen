The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 18%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 70%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 49%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 82%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 40%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 74%. The overall probability of smoking is 42%. Will smoking decrease the chance of being allergic to peanuts?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the absence of high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher for smokers (40%) than for nonsmokers (49%). This suggests that the positive association between smoking and being allergic to peanuts is primarily due to the higher likelihood of high tar deposit among smokers, rather than any direct effect of smoking on the risk of being allergic to peanuts.<|eot_id|>",
