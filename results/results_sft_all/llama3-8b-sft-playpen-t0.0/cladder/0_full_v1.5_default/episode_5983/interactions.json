The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. We know that full moon causes rain and sprinkler off. rain and sprinkler on causes wet ground. Would the ground is dry if no full moon instead of full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
