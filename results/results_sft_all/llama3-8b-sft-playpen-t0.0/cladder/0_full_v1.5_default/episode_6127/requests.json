If the person is not lactose intolerant, it means they are more likely to be hardworking. Since being hardworking is associated with being lactose intolerant, and being lazy is associated with not being lactose intolerant, the person's condition of not being lactose intolerant is more likely to be a result of being a non-smoker rather than a smoker.<|eot_id|>",
