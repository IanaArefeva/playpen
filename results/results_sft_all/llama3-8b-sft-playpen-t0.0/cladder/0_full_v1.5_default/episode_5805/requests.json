The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of having a brother is 97%. The probability of not having a brother and lung cancer is 2%. The probability of having a brother and lung cancer is 74%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, having a brother also has an indirect effect on lung cancer through its direct relationship with smoking. Since the probability of having a brother is 97%, and the probability of having a brother and lung cancer is 74%, we can conclude that the chance of lung cancer is larger when not observing having a brother. This is because the 2% probability of not having a brother and lung cancer is lower than the 74% probability of having a brother and lung cancer, which in turn is lower than the 97% probability of having a brother.<|eot_id|>",
