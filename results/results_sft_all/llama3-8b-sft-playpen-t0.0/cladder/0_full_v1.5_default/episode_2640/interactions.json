The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 85%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 11%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 75%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 35%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 74%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 36%. The overall probability of smoking is 53%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the given world, the probability of lung cancer is higher for both smokers and nonsmokers when there is no tar deposit (74% for smokers and 75% for nonsmokers) than when there is a high tar deposit (36% for smokers and 35% for nonsmokers). This suggests that the presence of a high tar deposit could actually reduce the chance of lung cancer, rather than increase it. Since the probability of high tar deposit is lower for smokers (11%) than for nonsmokers (85%), this could imply that smoking might reduce the chance of lung cancer.||",
