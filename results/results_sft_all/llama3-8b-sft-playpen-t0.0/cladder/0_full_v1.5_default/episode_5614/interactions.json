The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 55%. The probability of low hospital bill and thick lips is 17%. The probability of high hospital bill and thick lips is 40%. Is the chance of thick lips larger when observing high hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this context, the direct effect of hospital costs on thick lips is not the only cause of thick lips. The probability of thick lips is also directly related to the probability of hospital costs, which is 55%. The probability of thick lips is higher than the probability of a high hospital bill (40% vs 55%), and the probability of thick lips is also higher than the probability of a high hospital bill and thick lips (40% vs 17%). This suggests that the chance of thick lips is not larger when observing a high hospital bill, and that the direct relationship between hospital costs and thick lips is not the only cause of thick lips.||",
