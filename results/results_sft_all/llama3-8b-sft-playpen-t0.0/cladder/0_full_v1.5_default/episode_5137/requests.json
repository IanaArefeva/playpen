The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 36%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 43%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%. Is the chance of large feet larger when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of large feet is 43% when the education level is high school degree or lower, and it is 10% when the education level is college degree or higher. This indicates that large feet are more likely to occur when the education level is lower, rather than higher.<|eot_id|>",
