The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 85%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 62%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is 0.85 * 0.52 = 0.442, and the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers is 0.15 * 0.62 = 0.093. The total probability of lung cancer is 0.442 + 0.093 = 0.535. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.535 = 0.465. Since 0.535 > 0.465, lung cancer is more likely than absence of lung cancer in the entire population.<|eot_id|>",
