The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. The overall probability of encouragement is 84%. The probability of discouragement and brown eyes is 12%. The probability of encouragement and brown eyes is 47%. Is the chance of brown eyes smaller when observing encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since encouragement directly affects studying habits and studying habits directly affects brown eyes, we need to consider the joint effect of encouragement and studying habits on brown eyes. The probability of brown eyes given encouragement is 47%, and the probability of brown eyes given encouragement and studying habits is also 47%. This means that the chance of brown eyes is not smaller when observing encouragement; rather, it remains the same.||",
