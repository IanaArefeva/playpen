The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how liking spicy food correlates with cholera in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to poverty. To understand how liking spicy food affects cholera, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the absence of this unobserved variable, we can conclude that the direct relationship between liking spicy food and cholera is spurious and not causal. This is because the direct relationship between the two is likely being driven by the unobserved variable (poverty), which is associated with both liking spicy food and cholera. In this case, looking at the general correlation between liking spicy food and cholera (Method 1) would lead to a spurious conclusion that there is a direct causal relationship between the two, which is not the case. In contrast, looking at the relationship between liking spicy food and cholera on a case-by-case basis according to the unobserved variable (poverty) (Method 2) would reveal that the relationship is spurious and not direct, and that the unobserved variable is the true cause of both the relationship between the two and the individual's likelihood of having cholera.||",
