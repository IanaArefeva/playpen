Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between jazz and tar deposit is that jazz directly affects the probability of a higher tar deposit. Since the direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is that jazz directly affects the probability of lung cancer, and the direct relationship between tar deposit and lung cancer is that a higher tar deposit directly affects the probability of lung cancer, we can conclude that the direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is that jazz directly affects the probability of a higher tar deposit, which in turn directly affects the probability of lung cancer. This means that the direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is not a direct relationship, but rather an indirect relationship through the intermediate variable of tar deposit. In this case, the direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is that jazz directly affects the probability of a higher tar deposit, which in turn directly affects the probability of lung cancer, and the direct relationship between not listening to jazz and lung cancer is that not listening to jazz directly affects the probability of a lower tar deposit, which in turn directly affects the probability of lung cancer. Since the direct relationship between not listening to jazz and lung cancer is that not listening to jazz directly affects the probability of a lower tar deposit, which in turn directly affects the probability of lung cancer, and the direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is",
