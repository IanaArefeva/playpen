The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 10%. The probability of not listening to jazz and lung cancer is 24%. The probability of listening to jazz and lung cancer is 5%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing listening to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer given that one is not listening to jazz is 24%. The probability of lung cancer given that one is listening to jazz is the same as the probability of lung cancer given that one is not listening to jazz, which is 24%.
