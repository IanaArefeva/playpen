Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 53%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 43%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 55%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Additionally, the direct relationship between department competitiveness and admission status further solidifies the positive relationship between male gender and admission acceptance. Since the probability of male gender is 53%, which is higher than the probability of non-male (47%), the overall probability of admission acceptance is likely to be higher than that of admission rejection.<|eot_id|>",
