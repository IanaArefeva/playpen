The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of being able to swim is 47%. For students who cannot swim, the probability of high exam score is 25%. For students who can swim, the probability of high exam score is 75%. Is high exam score less likely than low exam score overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The studying habits of students who can and cannot swim are not directly related to their exam scores in this world. The exam score is primarily determined by the ability to swim. Since 47% of the students can swim and have a higher exam score, and 53% of the students cannot swim and have a lower exam score, the exam score is more likely to be high than low overall.<|eot_id|>",
