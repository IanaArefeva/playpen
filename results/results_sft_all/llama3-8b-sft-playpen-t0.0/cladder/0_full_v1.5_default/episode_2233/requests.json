Appearance has a direct effect on relationship status. For people in a relationship, the correlation between kindness and attractive appearance is -0.02. If we look at people in a relationship, does it mean that kindness does not affect attractive appearance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between kindness and attractive appearance is still subject to the direct effects of personality and appearance on relationship status. The negative correlation could be a result of the intervening variable (relationship status) rather than a direct causal relationship between kindness and attractive appearance.<|eot_id|>",
