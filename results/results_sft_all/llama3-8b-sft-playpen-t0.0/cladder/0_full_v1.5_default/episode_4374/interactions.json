The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 21%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 29%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 67%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 31%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 70%. The overall probability of smoking is 55%. Will smoking decrease the chance of being allergic to peanuts?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the absence of high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher for both smokers (31%) and nonsmokers (29%). The direct effect of smoking on being allergic to peanuts is not clear from the given data, and the increase in the probability of being allergic to peanuts among smokers is entirely accounted for by the higher probability of having high tar deposit, which in turn directly affects the probability of being allergic to peanuts.||",
