The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 49%. The probability of low hospital bill and thick lips is 20%. The probability of high hospital bill and thick lips is 31%. Is the chance of thick lips larger when observing high hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this context, the direct relationship between hospital costs and thick lips is not a one-way street. The probability of thick lips given a high hospital bill is not higher than the probability of thick lips in general, as the direct relationship between hospital costs and thick lips is symmetrical.<|eot_id|>",
