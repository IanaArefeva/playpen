The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 49%. The probability of low hospital bill and thick lips is 20%. The probability of high hospital bill and thick lips is 31%. Is the chance of thick lips larger when observing high hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this context, the direct relationship between hospital costs and thick lips is not a one-way street. The probability of thick lips given a high hospital bill is not higher than the probability of thick lips in general, as the direct relationship between hospital costs and thick lips is symmetrical.||",
