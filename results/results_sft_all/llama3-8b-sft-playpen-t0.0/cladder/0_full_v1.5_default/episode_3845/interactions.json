The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 51%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 21%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 56%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 10%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 48%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 67%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect peanut allergy?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
