The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 51%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 21%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 56%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 10%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 48%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 67%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect peanut allergy?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher for women (51%) than for women in a competitive department (21%), and higher for women in a non-competitive department than for women in a competitive department. This pattern is also seen in the male group, where the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher for those in a non-competitive department (56%) than for those in a competitive department (10%).<|eot_id|>",
