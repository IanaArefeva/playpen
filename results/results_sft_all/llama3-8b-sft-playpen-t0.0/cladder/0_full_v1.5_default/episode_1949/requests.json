Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 22%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 51%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high salary is higher for those with a college degree or higher (51%) than for those without (22%). This suggests that having a college degree or higher does increase the chance of having a high salary.<|eot_id|>",
