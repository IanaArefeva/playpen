The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 29%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 70%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 28%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 67%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 23%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 50%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 57%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 83%. The overall probability of high pollution is 52%. Does gene positively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer is higher for those with the smoking gene than for those without it, but this difference is entirely accounted for by the higher probability of smoking among those with the gene. The direct effect of the gene on lung cancer is zero, and the positive association between the gene and lung cancer is entirely due to the gene's effect on smoking behavior.||",
