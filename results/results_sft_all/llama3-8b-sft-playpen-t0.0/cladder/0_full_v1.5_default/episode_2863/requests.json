Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that waking up late or heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is heavy traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school late if waking up on time instead of waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that heavy traffic is present and that it directly affects Alice's arrival time, we can conclude that the condition of Alice waking up on time would not change the outcome of her arrival time. The primary factor determining whether she arrives late is the state of the road, not her wake-up time.<|eot_id|>",
