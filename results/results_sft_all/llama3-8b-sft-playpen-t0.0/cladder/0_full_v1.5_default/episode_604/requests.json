The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 22%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 42%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 78%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The observed differences in probability of high salary between those living far and close to a college can be attributed to the unobserved confounders and the direct relationship between college degree or higher and high salary, which is not fully isolated from the unobserved confounders.<|eot_id|>",
