The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and freckles. Hospital costs has a direct effect on freckles. Method 1: We look at how hospital costs correlates with freckles case by case according to age. Method 2: We look directly at how hospital costs correlates with freckles in general. To understand how hospital costs affects freckles, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
