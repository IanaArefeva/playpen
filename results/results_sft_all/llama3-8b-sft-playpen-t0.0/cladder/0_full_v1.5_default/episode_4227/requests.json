The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and freckles. Hospital costs has a direct effect on freckles. Method 1: We look at how hospital costs correlates with freckles case by case according to age. Method 2: We look directly at how hospital costs correlates with freckles in general. To understand how hospital costs affects freckles, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this case, looking at the general relationship between hospital costs and freckles (Method 2) is more appropriate than looking at the relationship case by case according to age (Method 1), as the direct effect of hospital costs on freckles is not dependent on the age of the individual.<|eot_id|>",
