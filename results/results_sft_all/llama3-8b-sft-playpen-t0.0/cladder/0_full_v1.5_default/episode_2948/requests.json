Since the direct relationship between male gender and competitive department is not inverted (i.e., male gender does not cause non-competitive department), we can conclude that male gender is a necessary condition for both competitive department and admission acceptance. In this context, the absence of male gender (i.e., non-male gender) would lead to a competitive department only if there is another condition that directly causes competitive department. If there is no such condition, then the absence of male gender would lead to a non-competitive department, and subsequent admission rejection.<|eot_id|>",
