The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 32%. The probability of reduced supply and increased price is 30%. The probability of increased supply and increased price is 18%. Is the chance of increased price larger when observing increased supply?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between demand and price means that demand exerts a direct influence on price, which is not subject to the intervening effects of supply. In the absence of any direct relationship between demand and supply, the observed increase in supply does not imply an increase in demand. The direct relationship between demand and price means that the probability of an increase in price is not dependent on the state of supply. The probability of an increase in price is determined by the direct relationship between demand and price, which is not subject to the intervening effects of supply.||",
