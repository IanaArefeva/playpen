The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 83%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 48%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 74%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 56%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 83%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of high tar deposit is higher than the probability of no tar deposit, the overall probability of lung cancer for a smoker is more likely to be higher than the probability of lung cancer for a nonsmoker, who has a 42% chance of lung cancer with no tar deposit and an 83% chance with high tar deposit. The higher probability of high tar deposit among smokers further tilts the balance in their favor, making it less likely for a smoker to have lower lung cancer risk than a nonsmoker.||",
