The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking gene is 10%. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 55%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of having a smoking gene is 10%, and the probability of having a nonsmoking gene is 90%. The probability of lung cancer in people with a smoking gene is 55%, and the probability of lung cancer in people with a nonsmoking gene is 44%. The overall probability of lung cancer is (0.1 * 0.55) + (0.9 * 0.44) = 0.0995 + 0.396 = 0.4955. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.4955 = 0.5045. Since 0.4955 is less than 0.5045, lung cancer is less likely than absence of lung cancer overall.<|eot_id|>",
