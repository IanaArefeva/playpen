The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on having a brother and disease. Having a brother has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of having a brother is 57%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 32%. For people who have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 63%. Is recovering from the disease less likely than dying from the disease overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
