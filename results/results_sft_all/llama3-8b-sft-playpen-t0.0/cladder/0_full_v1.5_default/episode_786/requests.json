The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 48%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of high salary is 53%. For individuals who are male, the probability of high salary is 78%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since occupation has a direct effect on salary, this further solidifies the link between male gender and higher salary. The unobserved skill variable likely exerts an influence on both occupation and salary, but its specific role is not directly quantifiable in this scenario. The key point is that male gender directly affects both occupation and salary, which in turn directly affects each other, creating a chain of cause and effect that ultimately leads to a higher likelihood of high salary among males.<|eot_id|>",
