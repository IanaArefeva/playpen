The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of having a brother is 78%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 39%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 46%. Is smallpox survival less likely than smallpox death overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of having a brother is 78%, the overall probability of smallpox survival is a weighted average of the two groups, which is higher than the probability of smallpox death.<|eot_id|>",
