The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 64%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 80%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 51%.
