The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Method 1: We look at how smoking correlates with lung cancer case by case according to tar deposit. Method 2: We look directly at how smoking correlates with lung cancer in general. To understand how smoking affects lung cancer, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not fully accounted for by looking at the individual relationships between each pair of variables (smoking, tar deposit, and lung cancer), as the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not fully represented by looking at the individual relationships between each pair of variables (smoking, tar deposit, and lung cancer).
