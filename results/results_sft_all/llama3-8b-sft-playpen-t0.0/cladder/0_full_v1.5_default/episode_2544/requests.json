The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 56%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 31%. Will smoking mother decrease the chance of high infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The health condition of the infant also exerts a direct effect on both birth weight and infant mortality. Since health condition is unobserved, we must consider its potential impact on the relationship between maternal smoking and infant mortality. If health condition is associated with higher birth weight and lower infant mortality, then the apparent protective effect of maternal smoking on infant mortality might be spurious. In other words, the observed reduction in infant mortality among children of smoking mothers could be due to the fact that health condition is more likely to be present in this group, rather than any direct effect of smoking on birth weight or mortality.<|eot_id|>",
