  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 92%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 85%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 51%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 47%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 80%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 34%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 44%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 12%. The overall probability of confounder active is 52%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect lactose intolerance through parents' social status?",
