The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and freckles. Hospital costs has a direct effect on freckles. Method 1: We look directly at how hospital costs correlates with freckles in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to age. To understand how hospital costs affects freckles, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

To fully understand how hospital costs affects freckles, we need to consider the intervening variable of age, which is directly related to both hospital costs and freckles. This is where Method 2 comes in - by looking at the relationship between hospital costs and freckles on a case-by-case basis according to age, we can control for the direct effect of age on both hospital costs and freckles, and thus more accurately identify the effect of hospital costs on freckles.||",
