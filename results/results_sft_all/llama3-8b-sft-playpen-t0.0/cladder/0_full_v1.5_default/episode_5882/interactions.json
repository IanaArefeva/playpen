The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a brother and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Having a brother has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a brother is 31%. For infants who do not have a brother, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 42%. For infants who have a brother, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 67%. Is normal infant birth weight more likely than low infant birth weight overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the unobserved confounder has a direct effect on both having a brother and normal infant birth weight, we must consider its influence when drawing conclusions about the relationship between having a brother and normal infant birth weight.\nGiven that the probability of normal infant birth weight is 42% for infants who do not have a brother and 67% for those who do, it might appear that having a brother is associated with a higher likelihood of normal birth weight. However, this association could be spurious, as both having a brother and normal birth weight might be influenced by the unobserved confounder.\nTo disentangle the relationships, we need to consider the joint distribution of having a brother and normal infant birth weight, taking into account the unobserved confounder. Since the unobserved confounder is unobserved, we must use the available data to make inferences about its effects.\nThe probability of having a brother is 31%, and for those who do not have a brother, the probability of normal birth weight is 42%. This means that for 69% of the population (100% - 31%), the probability of normal birth weight is 42%. For the remaining 31% who have a brother, the probability of normal birth weight is 67%.\nTo conclude whether normal birth weight is more likely than low birth weight",
