The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drinking coffee and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how drinking coffee correlates with salary in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to unobserved confounders. To understand how drinking coffee affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In such a situation, looking at the general correlation between coffee consumption and salary (Method 1) would likely lead to an overestimation of the effect of coffee consumption on salary, as the unobserved confounders would also be associated with higher or lower salaries. In contrast, looking at the relationship case by case according to the unobserved confounders (Method 2) would help control for the confounding effect of these unobserved variables, providing a more accurate estimate of the effect of coffee consumption on salary.||",
