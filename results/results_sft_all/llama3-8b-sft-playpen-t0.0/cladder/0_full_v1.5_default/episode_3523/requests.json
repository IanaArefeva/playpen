Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 36%. The probability of taking the stairs and large feet is 29%. The probability of taking the elevator and large feet is 17%.

The direct relationship between my decision and penguin mood, and between penguin mood and foot size, does not imply a direct relationship between my decision and foot size.\n2. The probability of large feet is not directly related to the probability of taking the elevator. The only direct relationship is between penguin mood and foot size.\n3. The given probabilities (36% for taking the elevator, 29% for taking the stairs and large feet, and 17% for taking the elevator and large feet) do not directly imply that the chance of large feet is larger when observing taking the elevator.\n4. The correct relationship can be established by looking at the joint probability of large feet and taking the stairs (29%) and the joint probability of large feet and taking the elevator (17%). The joint probability of large feet and taking the stairs is higher than the joint probability of large feet and taking the elevator, which suggests that the chance of large feet is larger when taking the stairs than when taking the elevator.\n5. Since the direct relationship is between penguin mood and foot size, and the mood is not directly related to the decision of taking the stairs or the elevator, we need to look at the joint probabilities to establish the correct relationship.\n6. The joint probability of large feet and taking the stairs is higher than the joint probability of large feet and taking the elevator, which suggests that the chance of large feet is larger",
