The candle has a direct effect on room. We know that liking spicy food or candle with wax causes dark room. We observed the candle has wax. Would the room is dark if not liking spicy food instead of liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
