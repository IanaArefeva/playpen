  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 6%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 19%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 85%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 96%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 55%. For people getting the vaccine, would it be less likely to see recovering from the disease if the person had not refused the vaccine?",
