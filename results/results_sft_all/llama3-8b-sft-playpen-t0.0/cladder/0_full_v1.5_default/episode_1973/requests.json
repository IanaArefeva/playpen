Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 89%. The probability of high school degree or lower and high salary is 3%. The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 58%. Is the chance of high salary larger when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that having a college degree or higher does not guarantee a high salary, and there might be other intervening factors that reduce the likelihood of high salary among those with a college degree or higher.<|eot_id|>",
