The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 97%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 1%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 57%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer is also directly related to the probability of not smoking, which is 3% in this world. Since the probability of not smoking is so small, the direct relationship between not smoking and lung cancer is the primary cause of lung cancer in this world. The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not the primary cause of lung cancer, and the probability of lung cancer is not smaller when observing smoking.<|eot_id|>",
