The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 42%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 55%. For smokers, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 64%. Is being allergic to peanuts less likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 64% for smokers and 55% for nonsmokers, and the overall probability of smoking is 42%, we can conclude that the higher probability of being allergic to peanuts among smokers than among nonsmokers more than counterbalances the lower probability of being a smoker, leading to a higher overall probability of being allergic to peanuts than not being allergic to peanuts.<|eot_id|>",
