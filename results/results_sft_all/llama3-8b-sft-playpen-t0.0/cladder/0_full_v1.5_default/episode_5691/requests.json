The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 74%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 97%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 44%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 69%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 58%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 22%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 78%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 50%. The overall probability of good health is 1%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would having a sister positively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The table only provides the probability of high infant mortality for different groups of infants, which does not directly imply a positive or negative effect of having a sister on infant's birth weight. The table does not provide any direct information about the relationship between having a sister and birth weight, which is necessary to conclude whether having a sister would have a positive or negative effect on infant's birth weight.<|eot_id|>",
