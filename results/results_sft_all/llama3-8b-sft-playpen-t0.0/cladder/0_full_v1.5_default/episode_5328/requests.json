The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 41%. For people who do not drink coffee and non-hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 93%. For people who do not drink coffee and hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 69%. For people who drink coffee and non-hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 93%. For people who drink coffee and hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 75%. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does the chance of broken bones increase when drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The difference in probability between hospitalization and non hospitalization is 26% for those who do not drink coffee and 18% for those who drink coffee. The difference in probability between those who drink coffee and those who do not is 6% for hospitalization and 0% for non hospitalization. The increase in probability of broken bones when hospitalization is 26% for those who do not drink coffee and 18% for those who drink coffee, which is a larger difference for those who do not drink coffee than for those who drink coffee.<|eot_id|>",
