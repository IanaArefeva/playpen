Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 64%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 79%. Will having a brother increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The increase in the probability of high salary among those who have a brother (79% vs 64%) can be attributed to the positive effect of skill on salary, which is also directly related to having a brother. This chain of relationships does not establish a direct link between having a brother and the chance of high salary.<|eot_id|>",
