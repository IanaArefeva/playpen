The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 75%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 23%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 75%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 46%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 39%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 17%. The overall probability of high pollution is 6%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would gene negatively affect lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The gene also affects the probability of smoking, which in turn affects the probability of lung cancer. In particular, for people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is lower than for those with nonsmoking genes, both when they smoke and when they don't. This suggests that the gene has a negative effect on lung cancer through its influence on smoking behavior.<|eot_id|>",
