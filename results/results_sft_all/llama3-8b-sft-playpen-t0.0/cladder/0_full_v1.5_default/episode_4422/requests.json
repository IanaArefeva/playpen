The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 18%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 46%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 77%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 17%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 43%. The overall probability of smoking is 49%. Will smoking decrease the chance of being allergic to peanuts?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the absence of high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher for nonsmokers than for smokers (46% vs. 17%). This suggests that the direct effect of not smoking (or being a nonsmoker) on being allergic to peanuts is positive. The increase in the probability of being allergic to peanuts when moving from no tar deposit to high tar deposit is also higher for nonsmokers than for smokers (31% vs. 26%). This further supports the idea that the direct effect of not smoking on being allergic to peanuts is positive.<|eot_id|>",
