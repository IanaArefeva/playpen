Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 50%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 64%. For people who drink coffee, would it be more likely to see ringing alarm if the person did not drink coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is determined by the direct effect of the coffee and the direct effect of the wife, not by the person's behavior in the past (not drinking coffee). The person's past behavior does not influence the direct effects of the coffee and the wife on the alarm clock.<|eot_id|>",
