  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 89%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 86%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 45%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 47%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 92%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 70%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 55%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 24%. The overall probability of confounder active is 49%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would parents' intelligence negatively affect lactose intolerance?",
