The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 9%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 87%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 41%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 66%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 27%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 53%. The overall probability of smoking is 44%. Does smoking negatively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is not fully captured by the relationship through tar deposit. The probability of lung cancer among smokers is higher than among nonsmokers, but this difference is not entirely accounted for by the difference in the probability of high tar deposit between the two groups. The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer likely still exists, separate from its effect through tar deposit.||",
