  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 36%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 39%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 68%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 67%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 56%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 55%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 8%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 24%. The overall probability of confounder active is 42%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?",
