For smokers and are lazy, the probability of freckles is 49%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of freckles is 21%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 24%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 66%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking positively affect freckles?",
