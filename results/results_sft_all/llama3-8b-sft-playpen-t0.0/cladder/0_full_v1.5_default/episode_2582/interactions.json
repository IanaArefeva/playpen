The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 86%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 51%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 76%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 43%. The overall probability of smoking is 82%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than that among nonsmokers in both the no tar and high tar scenarios. This counterintuitive finding can be explained by the intervening variable of tar deposit. The higher probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with high tar deposit compared to those with no tar deposit suggests that the presence of tar is a more significant risk factor than smoking. In the absence of direct information about the unobserved variable of gender, we must consider the joint effects of smoking and tar on lung cancer. The lower probability of lung cancer among smokers with high tar deposit compared to those with no tar deposit further blurs the direct link between smoking and lung cancer. In light of this, we conclude that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not as direct as it might appear, and that the intervening variable of tar deposit plays a more significant role in determining the risk of lung cancer.||",
