The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that liking spicy food or confounder active causes high parental social status. liking spicy food or confounder active or high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder inactive. Would the child is not intelligent if not liking spicy food instead of liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we know that liking spicy food or the confounder active cause high parental social status, and that high parental social status in turn affects child's intelligence, we can conclude that the child's intelligence is not entirely dependent on the parents' social status. The child's individual traits, which are not directly observable, also play a role in determining their intelligence. If the child's individual traits are such that they lead to high intelligence, then the child will still be intelligent even if they do not like spicy food.||",
