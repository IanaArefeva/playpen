Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence.

Since we know that liking spicy food or the confounder active cause high parental social status, and that high parental social status in turn affects child's intelligence, we can conclude that the child's intelligence is not entirely dependent on the parents' social status. The child's individual traits, which are not directly observable, also play a role in determining their intelligence. If the child's individual traits are such that they lead to high intelligence, then the child will still be intelligent even if they do not like spicy food.<|eot_id|>",
