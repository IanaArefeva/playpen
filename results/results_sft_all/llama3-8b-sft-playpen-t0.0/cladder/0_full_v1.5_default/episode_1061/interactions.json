The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 4%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 25%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 76%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 98%. The overall probability of male gender is 59%. Will receives treatment decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of male gender is higher than the probability of not male (41%), and the probability of recovery for male patients not receiving treatment is higher than the probability of recovery for not male patients not receiving treatment (4%). This suggests that male patients are more likely to recover than not male patients, and that this difference is not fully explained by the absence of treatment.||",
