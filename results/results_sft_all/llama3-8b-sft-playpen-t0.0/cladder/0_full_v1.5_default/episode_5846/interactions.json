The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Method 1: We look at how having a sister correlates with lung cancer case by case according to tar deposit. Method 2: We look directly at how having a sister correlates with lung cancer in general. To understand how having a sister affects lung cancer, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this chain of causality, having a sister is the root cause, and lung cancer is the final effect. To establish the relationship between having a sister and lung cancer, we should directly examine the general correlation between the two, rather than looking at the intermediate step of tar deposit. This approach allows us to identify the direct causal link between having a sister and lung cancer, which is the primary goal of causal inference.||",
