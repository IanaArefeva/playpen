Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 44%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 62%. Will smoking increase the chance of college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, the direct effect of smoking on college admission is not the only relevant relationship in this system. The direct effect of effort on college admission is also positive, and the direct effect of smoking on effort is not specified. In the absence of any information about the relationship between smoking and effort, we must consider the possibility that the positive direct effect of smoking on college admission could be offset by a negative direct effect of smoking on effort, which in turn could reduce the probability of college admission. Since we have no information about the relationship between smoking and effort, we must conclude that the net effect of smoking on college admission is uncertain and could potentially be negative.<|eot_id|>",
