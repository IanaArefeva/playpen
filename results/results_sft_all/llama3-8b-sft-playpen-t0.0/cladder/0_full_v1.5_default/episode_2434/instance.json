Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 97%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 75%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 24%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 2%. The overall probability of old age is 57%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?",
