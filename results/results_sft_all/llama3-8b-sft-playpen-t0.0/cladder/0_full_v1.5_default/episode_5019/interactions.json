The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 56%. For people who do not have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 83%. For people who have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 27%. For people who have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 51%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 41%. For people who have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 71%. If we disregard the mediation effect through blood pressure, would having a sister positively affect heart condition?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
