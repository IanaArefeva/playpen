The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of clean water is 26%. For people with only polluted water, the probability of cholera contraction is 75%. For people with access to clean water, the probability of cholera contraction is 52%. Is cholera contraction less likely than cholera prevention overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 26% of the time, people have clean water and the probability of cholera contraction is 52%, and 74% of the time, people have polluted water and the probability of cholera contraction is 75%. The overall probability of cholera contraction is the weighted average of these two scenarios, which is (0.26 * 0.52) + (0.74 * 0.75) = 0.5734. The probability of cholera prevention is the probability of having clean water, which is 0.26. Since 0.5734 is greater than 0.26, cholera contraction is more likely than cholera prevention overall.||",
