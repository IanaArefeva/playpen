Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 83%. For normal weight people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 60%. For obese people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 59%. For obese people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 37%. For normal weight people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 35%. For normal weight people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 24%. For obese people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 67%. For obese people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 56%. The overall probability of smoker is 5%. Does obesity positively affect lifespan through diabetes?",
