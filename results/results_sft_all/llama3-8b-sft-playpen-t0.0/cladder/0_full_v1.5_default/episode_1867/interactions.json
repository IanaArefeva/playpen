The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 6%. The probability of not taking medication and healthy heart is 75%. The probability of taking medication and healthy heart is 1%. Is the chance of healthy heart smaller when observing taking medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is that higher blood pressure can lead to heart condition. The probability of taking medication is 6%, and the probability of not taking medication and having a healthy heart is 75%. The probability of taking medication and having a healthy heart is 1%. The key point here is that medication can reduce heart condition, so if we condition on taking medication, the heart condition is likely to be better than if we condition on not taking medication. The 1% probability of taking medication and having a healthy heart is still higher than the 0.5% probability of not taking medication and having a heart condition (75% of 1% is 0.75%, and 1% of 1% is 0.01%). This suggests that the chance of a healthy heart is not smaller when observing taking medication, but rather that the chance of a heart condition is lower when taking medication.||",
