Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of respiratory issues is 57%. For people with no respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 18%. For people with respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 18%. Is broken bones more likely than no broken bones overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of respiratory issues is 57%, this means that 57% of the population has respiratory issues and 43% does not. The overall probability of broken bones is then a weighted average of the two groups: (0.57 * 0.18) + (0.43 * 0.18) = 0.16. This is less than the probability of no broken bones (1 - 0.16 = 0.84), so broken bones is less likely than no broken bones overall.<|eot_id|>",
