The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender and in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes brown eyes. We observed the residency is out-of-state. Would the applicant has blue eyes if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If the applicant is not male, this chain is broken, and we must consider the direct relationship between non-male gender and brown eyes. Since we already know that in-state residency and male gender lead to brown eyes, and we have no information about the direct relationship between non-male gender and brown eyes, we must conclude that the applicant would not have brown eyes. Since the direct relationship between brown eyes and blue eyes is not established, we can conclude that the applicant would have blue eyes.<|eot_id|>",
