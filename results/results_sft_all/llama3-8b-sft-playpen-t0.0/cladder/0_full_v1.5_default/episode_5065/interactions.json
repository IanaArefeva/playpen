The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 54%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 52%. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of having a sister is 79%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of having a sister is 43%. Will having a sister decrease the chance of low cholesterol?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between being assigned the drug treatment and having a sister is also positive, meaning that being assigned the drug treatment is associated with having a lower probability of having a sister. The direct relationship between being assigned the drug treatment and having a lower cholesterol level is also positive, meaning that being assigned the drug treatment is associated with a lower probability of having a lower cholesterol level.
