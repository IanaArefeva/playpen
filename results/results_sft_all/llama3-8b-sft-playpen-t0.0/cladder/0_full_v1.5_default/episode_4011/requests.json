Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 31%. For children who like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 62%. Will liking spicy food increase the chance of intelligent child?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This positive direct effect is counterbalanced by the direct negative effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence, which is not accounted for in the given information. The parents' social status is directly related to their children's intelligence, and since the direct effect of liking spicy food on child's intelligence is positive, we need to consider the counteracting force of parents' social status. The direct positive effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence would reduce the overall positive effect of liking spicy food on child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
