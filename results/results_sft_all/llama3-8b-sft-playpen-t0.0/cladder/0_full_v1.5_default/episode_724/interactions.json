The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 43%. The probability of non-male gender and admission acceptance is 41%. The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 28%. Is the chance of admission acceptance smaller when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 28%, which is lower than the probability of non-male gender and admission acceptance (41%). This might initially lead one to conclude that male gender is associated with lower admission acceptance. However, we must consider the direct relationship between male gender and department competitiveness, as well as the direct relationship between department competitiveness and admission acceptance. If male gender is associated with higher department competitiveness, and higher department competitiveness is associated with higher admission acceptance, then male gender could still be associated with higher admission acceptance, even if the direct relationship between male gender and admission acceptance is not immediately obvious.||",
