Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 14%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 34%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer is higher for those who listen to jazz (34%) than for those who do not (14%). This difference in probability is entirely due to the direct effect of jazz on tar deposit, which in turn affects the probability of lung cancer. If we condition on not listening to jazz, we are essentially removing the direct effect of jazz on tar deposit, and the remaining relationship between not listening to jazz and lung cancer is still characterized by a lower probability of lung cancer (14%) compared to the general population.<|eot_id|>",
