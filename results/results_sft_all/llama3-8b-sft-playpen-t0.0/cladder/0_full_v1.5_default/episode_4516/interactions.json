The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 14%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 34%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer is higher for those who listen to jazz (34%) than for those who do not (14%). This difference in probability is entirely due to the direct effect of jazz on tar deposit, which in turn affects the probability of lung cancer. If we condition on not listening to jazz, we are essentially removing the direct effect of jazz on tar deposit, and the remaining relationship between not listening to jazz and lung cancer is still characterized by a lower probability of lung cancer (14%) compared to the general population.||",
