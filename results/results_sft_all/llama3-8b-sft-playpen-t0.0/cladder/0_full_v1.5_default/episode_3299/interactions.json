The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of having a sister is 68%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 21%. For people who have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 65%. Is the prisoner's death less likely than the prisoner being alive overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the prisoner's death is higher for those who have a sister (65%) than for those who do not (21%). This suggests that having a sister is associated with a higher risk of the prisoner's death, rather than a lower risk.||",
