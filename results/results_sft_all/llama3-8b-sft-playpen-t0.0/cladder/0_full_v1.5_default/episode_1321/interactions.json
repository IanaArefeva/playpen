The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people with smoking genes, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had a nonsmoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between the gene and smoking is that people with a smoking gene are more likely to smoke. The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is that smoking directly causes lung cancer. The direct relationship between pollution and both smoking and lung cancer is that pollution directly affects both smoking and lung cancer. The key point here is that the gene directly affects both the probability of lung cancer and the probability of smoking, and the direct relationship between the gene and lung cancer is that the gene with a higher probability of lung cancer is the one that also has a higher probability of smoking. This means that the higher probability of lung cancer associated with the smoking gene is entirely due to the higher probability of smoking associated with that gene, and not any direct effect of the gene on lung cancer.||",
