For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 75%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 27%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 11%. The overall probability of old age is 54%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?",
