It does not imply that kindness has no effect on attractive appearance outside of this specific condition. In fact, the direct relationship between personality and relationship status, and between appearance and relationship status, suggests that personality and appearance can still influence relationship formation and maintenance, which in turn can lead to differences in kindness and attractive appearance. The specific correlation of 0.14 between kindness and attractive appearance in people already in a relationship does not preclude the possibility that kindness can still affect attractive appearance outside of this condition.<|eot_id|>",
