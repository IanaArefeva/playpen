The relationship between two variables can be negative without one directly canceling the effect of the other. In this case, the negative correlation might indicate that students who are more likely to be hard-working are less likely to be jazz fans, but it does not rule out the possibility that jazz still exerts an independent effect on being hard-working.<|eot_id|>",
