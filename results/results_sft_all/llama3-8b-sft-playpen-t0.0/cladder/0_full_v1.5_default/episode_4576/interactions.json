The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 13%. The probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm is 63%. The probability of having a brother and ringing alarm is 3%. Is the chance of ringing alarm larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only direct relationship we have is that having a brother affects the wife, and the wife affects the alarm clock. The probability of having a brother and ringing an alarm is 3%, which is lower than the probability of not having a brother and ringing an alarm (63%).
