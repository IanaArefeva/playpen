The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 86%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 80%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 24%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 12%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 54%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

For small kidney stones, treatment actually decreases the chance of recovery (86% without treatment vs. 80% with treatment), while for large kidney stones, treatment also decreases the chance of recovery (24% without treatment vs. 12% with treatment). This pattern of treatment decreasing the chance of recovery for both small and large kidney stones suggests that the overall effect of treatment on recovery is negative.||",
