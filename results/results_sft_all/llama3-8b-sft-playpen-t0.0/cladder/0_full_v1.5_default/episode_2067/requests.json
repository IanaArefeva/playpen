The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of encouragement is 98%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 65%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 62%. Is high exam score more likely than low exam score overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of a high exam score is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.6084 + 0.013 = 0.6214. The probability of a low exam score is 1 - 0.6214 = 0.3786. Since 0.3786 is less than 0.5, a high exam score is more likely than a low exam score for students who are not encouraged.<|eot_id|>",
