Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. We know that smoking causes absence of tar deposit, and we know that high tar deposit causes absence of lung cancer. Would the person has no lung cancer if smoking instead of nonsmoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The absence of lung cancer is associated with high tar deposit, not with the absence of tar deposit. If the person smoked, they would likely have a lower tar deposit, which would lead to a higher risk of lung cancer, not a lower risk.<|eot_id|>",
