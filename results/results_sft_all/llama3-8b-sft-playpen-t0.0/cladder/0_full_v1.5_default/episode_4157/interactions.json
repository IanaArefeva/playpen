The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 14%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 25%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 72%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 90%. The overall probability of male gender is 41%. Will having a brother decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

          "content": "No\nThe probability of having a brother is higher for male patients (90%) than for female patients (0%). Since the probability of male gender is 41%, this means that a larger fraction of the total patient pool is male and has a brother. In this subpopulation, the probability of recovery is 90%, which is higher than the 72% probability of recovery for male patients without a brother. Additionally, the probability of having a brother is lower for female patients (0%) than for male patients (90%), which further supports the idea that having a brother is associated with higher recovery rates.||",
