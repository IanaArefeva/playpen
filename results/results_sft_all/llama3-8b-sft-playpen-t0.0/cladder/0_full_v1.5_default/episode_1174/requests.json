Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 57%. The probability of vaccine refusal and recovering from the disease is 32%. The probability of getting the vaccine and recovering from the disease is 22%. Is the chance of recovering from the disease larger when observing getting the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of vaccine refusal and recovery is higher than the probability of vaccine and recovery, it suggests that the chance of recovering from the disease is larger when not observing the vaccine.<|eot_id|>",
