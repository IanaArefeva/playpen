Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 47%. For students who are not talented, the probability of being hard-working is 57%. For students who are talented, the probability of being hard-working is 57%. Is being hard-working more likely than being lazy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since 47% of the students are talented and 53% are not, we can conclude that the overall probability of being hard-working is a weighted average of the two groups, which is (0.47 * 0.57) + (0.53 * 0.57) = 0.57. In other words, the overall probability of being hard-working is exactly the same as the probability of being lazy (57%).<|eot_id|>",
