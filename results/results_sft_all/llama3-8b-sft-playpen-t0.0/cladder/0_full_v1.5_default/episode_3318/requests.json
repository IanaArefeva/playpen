The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of having a sister is 76%. The probability of not having a sister and the prisoner's death is 7%. The probability of having a sister and the prisoner's death is 58%. Is the chance of the prisoner's death larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is because the direct effect of having a sister on the corporal and the private is positive, which counteracts the direct negative effect of the corporal and the private on the prisoner. In the absence of a sister, the negative direct effects of the corporal and the private on the prisoner are not offset by the positive direct effects of the sister, leading to a higher probability of the prisoner's death.<|eot_id|>",
