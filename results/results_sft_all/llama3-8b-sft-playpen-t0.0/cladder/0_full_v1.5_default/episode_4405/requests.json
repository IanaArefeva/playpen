The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 34%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 59%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 42%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 69%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 25%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 78%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In both scenarios, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher than the corresponding probability for a nonsmoker (34% and 59%, respectively). This suggests that the direct effect of being a smoker on being allergic to peanuts is positive, and the additional effect of having a high tar deposit further increases this probability. Since the direct effect of being a smoker on being allergic to peanuts is positive, it is not less likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the person had been a nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
