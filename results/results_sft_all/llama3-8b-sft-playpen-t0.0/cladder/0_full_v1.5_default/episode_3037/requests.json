Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. We know that old age causes high hospital bill. old age or high hospital bill causes recovery. We observed the patient is old.

Since the patient is old and we already know that old age leads to high hospital costs, we can conclude that the patient will have a high hospital bill. With a high hospital bill, the patient is likely to recover. If we were to change the hospital bill to a low one, we would be breaking the direct relationship between hospital costs and recovery, which is that high hospital costs lead to a higher chance of recovery. In this new scenario, the patient's old age still leads to a high hospital bill, but the hospital bill is now low, which would lead to a lower chance of recovery.<|eot_id|>",
