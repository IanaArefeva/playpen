The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 67%. For people with smoking genes, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had a nonsmoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that having a smoking gene directly increases the likelihood of lung cancer. The direct relationship between the gene and smoking is that people with a smoking gene are more likely to smoke, which in turn directly affects the likelihood of lung cancer. Since the person already has a smoking gene, the additional presence of a nonsmoking gene would not reduce the likelihood of lung cancer; rather, it would likely have no effect on the already higher probability of lung cancer associated with the smoking gene.||",
