The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on rainfall. Sprinkler has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of rainy season is 95%. For people in the dry season, the probability of high rainfall is 49%. For in the rainy season, the probability of high rainfall is 49%. Is high rainfall more likely than low rainfall overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of a rainy season is 95%, this means that the vast majority of the time (95% of the time), the weather is already rainy, and the probability of high rainfall in that case is 49%. In the remaining 5% of the time when the weather is dry, the probability of high rainfall is also 49%. Since the two scenarios (rainy and dry) are weighted so heavily towards the rainy condition, the overall probability of high rainfall is still lower than the probability of low rainfall.||",
