The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Method 1: We look directly at how gender correlates with lactose intolerance in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to department competitiveness. To understand how gender affects lactose intolerance, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the effect of gender on lactose intolerance is not uniform across all contexts but rather depends on the specific departmental setting. Method 1, which looks at the general correlation between gender and lactose intolerance without accounting for the intervening variable of department competitiveness, would likely overestimate or misestimate the direct effect of gender on lactose intolerance. In contrast, Method 2, which controls for the intervening variable of department competitiveness, would provide a more accurate picture of how gender affects lactose intolerance by accounting for the mediating role of this intervening variable.||",
