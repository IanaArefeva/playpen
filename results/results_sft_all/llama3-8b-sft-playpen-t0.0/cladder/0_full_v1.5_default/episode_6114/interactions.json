The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. We know that having visited England or high skill level causes white-collar job. having visited England or high skill level or white-collar job causes high salary. We observed the person has a low skill level. Would the employee has a high salary if having visited England instead of not having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since having a white-collar job is a necessary condition for having a high salary, and we already know that the person has a white-collar job, we can conclude that the person's white-collar job is the primary driver of their high salary. The direct effect of having visited England on white-collar job and salary is not strong enough to counteract the negative effect of the person's low skill level. In this scenario, the person's white-collar job is the primary cause of their high salary, and having visited England is not a sufficient condition to ensure a high salary given the person's low skill level.||",
