The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 55%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 80%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 40%. Is cholera contraction less likely than cholera prevention overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the overall probability of liking spicy food is 55%, we can weight the probabilities of cholera contraction by this fraction: (0.4 * 0.55) + (0.8 * 0.45) = 0.22 + 0.36 = 0.58. The probability of cholera prevention is 1 - 0.58 = 0.42. Since 0.58 is greater than 0.42, cholera contraction is more likely than cholera prevention overall.||",
