The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. We know that obesity or smoker causes having diabetes. obesity or smoker or having diabetes causes long lifespan. We observed the person is a nonsmoker. Would the person has a short lifespan if normal weight instead of obesity?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we also know that obesity or having diabetes is a direct cause of long lifespan, and the person is a nonsmoker, we can conclude that the person is not having diabetes. If the person is not having diabetes and is a nonsmoker, then the person's weight must be normal, and we already know that normal weight is not a direct cause of short lifespan. Since there are no other direct causes of short lifespan in this world (smoking is unobserved and we already accounted for the person's weight and diabetes), we can conclude that the person will not have a short lifespan if they are normal weight.||",
