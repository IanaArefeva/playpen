The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. Method 1: We look directly at how vaccination correlates with disease in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to pre-conditions. To understand how vaccination affects disease, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In other words, the effect of vaccination on disease is not the same for every individual, and this difference is directly related to the pre-conditions. If we look at the general correlation between vaccination and disease without taking into account the specific pre-conditions, we risk misestimating the true relationship between these two variables. In particular, we might conclude that vaccination has a positive effect on disease when, in fact, this is only true for a specific subpopulation of individuals with particular pre-conditions. In this case, looking at the relationship case by case according to pre-conditions (Method 2) is more appropriate than looking at the general correlation (Method 1), as it allows us to account for the variations in the effect of vaccination on disease across different subpopulations.||",
