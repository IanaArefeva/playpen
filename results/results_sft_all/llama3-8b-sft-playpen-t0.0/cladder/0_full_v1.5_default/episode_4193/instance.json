Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 2%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 24%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 74%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 93%. The overall probability of male gender is 56%.
