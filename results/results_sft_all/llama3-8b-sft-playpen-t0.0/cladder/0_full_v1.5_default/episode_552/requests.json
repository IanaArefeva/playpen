The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 2%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 13%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 58%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that only 1.16% of the population (2% of 58%) has both a college degree and a high salary. The remaining 98.84% of the college degree holders have a lower salary. In the 98% of the population without a college degree, the probability of a high salary is 13%. This means that 12.76% of the total population (13% of 98%) has a high salary. Since 1.16% is less than 12.76%, the probability of a high salary is higher than that of a lower salary in the entire population.<|eot_id|>",
