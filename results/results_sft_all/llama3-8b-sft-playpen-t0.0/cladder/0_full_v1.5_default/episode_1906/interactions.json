The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 95%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 93%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 93%. Is talent less likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the difference in probability of talent between the two groups is entirely due to the difference in their probability of being unattractive (95% for unattractive vs. 5% for attractive). Since the probability of being unattractive is higher than the probability of being attractive, the overall probability of having talent is higher than the probability of lacking it.||",
