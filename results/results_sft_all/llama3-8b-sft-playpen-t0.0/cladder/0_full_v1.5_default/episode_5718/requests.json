The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 46%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 71%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 18%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 46%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 59%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 19%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 83%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 44%. The overall probability of good health is 18%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would having a sister negatively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The table only provides the probability of high infant mortality for different subgroups of infants, which does not directly imply a negative effect of having a sister on infant's birth weight. In the subgroups where having a sister is present (with a sister and normal birth weight, and with a sister and poor health), the probability of high infant mortality is 46% and 46% respectively, which is lower than the 71% probability of high infant mortality in the subgroups without a sister and normal birth weight. This suggests that having a sister might reduce the risk of high infant mortality, rather than increase it.<|eot_id|>",
