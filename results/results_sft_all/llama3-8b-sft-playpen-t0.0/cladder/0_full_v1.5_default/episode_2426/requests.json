Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 57%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 38%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 84%.

The probability of being male is not directly related to the probability of being in the \"treatment\" or \"recovery\" groups, and the probability of being male is not a direct cause of the probability of being in the \"recovery\" group. The only direct relationship is between \"treatment\" and \"recovery\", and the probability of \"recovery\" is lower than the probability of \"non-recovery\" in the absence of \"treatment\".<|eot_id|>",
