Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. We know that rainy season causes rain and sprinkler off. rain or sprinkler on causes wet ground. Would the ground is wet if rainy season instead of dry season?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
