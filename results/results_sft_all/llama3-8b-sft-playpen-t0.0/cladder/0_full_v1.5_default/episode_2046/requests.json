Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 82%. For students who are not talented, the probability of being hard-working is 89%. For students who are talented, the probability of being hard-working is 89%.

The 89% probability of being hard-working among both groups supersedes any differences in the probability of being talented (82%) or not (18%).<|eot_id|>",
