Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 44%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 75%. Will drinking coffee decrease the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the wife's state is not directly related to the person's coffee consumption, we can conclude that the positive direct effect of coffee on the alarm clock supersedes any potential negative indirect effect through the wife.<|eot_id|>",
