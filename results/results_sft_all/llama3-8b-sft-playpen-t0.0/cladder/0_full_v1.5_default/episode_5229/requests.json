The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 88%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 13%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see being lactose intolerant if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The additional condition that being male has a direct positive effect on department competitiveness, which in turn has a direct positive effect on the probability of being lactose intolerant, does not change the fact that being male still has a lower associated probability of being lactose intolerant compared to being female.<|eot_id|>",
