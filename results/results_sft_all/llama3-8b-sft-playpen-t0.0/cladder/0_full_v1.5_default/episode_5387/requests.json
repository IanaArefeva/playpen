The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 88%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 48%. For children with intelligent parents, would it be less likely to see being lactose intolerant if the child had unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that having intelligent parents already reduces the likelihood of being lactose intolerant by 40 percentage points. If we further condition on the child having intelligent parents, we are already in the lower risk group (48% probability), and the additional information that the child's parents are unintelligent does not change the risk level. The risk remains at 48% since the parents' intelligence is already accounted for in the lower risk group.<|eot_id|>",
