  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 62%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 28%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 27%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 97%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 45%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?",
