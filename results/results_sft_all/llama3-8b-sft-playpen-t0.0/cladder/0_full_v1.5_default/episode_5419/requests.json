The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and freckles. Effort has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of smoking is 87%. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 88%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 67%. Is freckles less likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of freckles for smokers is 67%, and the probability of no freckles for smokers is 33%. Since the probability of no freckles for both nonsmokers and smokers is less than the probability of freckles, and the overall probability of smoking is 87%, the overall probability of no freckles is less than the overall probability of freckles.<|eot_id|>",
