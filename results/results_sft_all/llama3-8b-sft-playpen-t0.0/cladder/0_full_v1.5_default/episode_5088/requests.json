Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 27%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 41%. Does having a brother negatively affect salary through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high salary is higher for those with a brother (41%) than for those without a brother (27%), which suggests that having a brother has a positive effect on salary through skill.<|eot_id|>",
