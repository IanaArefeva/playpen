The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Respiratory issues has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Black hair has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of respiratory issues is 47%. For people with no respiratory issues, the probability of black hair is 17%. For people with respiratory issues, the probability of black hair is 17%. Is black hair less likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
