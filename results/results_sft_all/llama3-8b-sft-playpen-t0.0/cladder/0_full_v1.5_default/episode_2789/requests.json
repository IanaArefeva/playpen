The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 64%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 47%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of clean water is 70%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of clean water is 28%. Will clean water increase the chance of cholera contraction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this system, water quality is the direct cause of both clean water and the probability of cholera contraction. Since the probability of clean water is higher for people served by a local water company (70%) than for those served by a global water company (28%), we can conclude that local water company is associated with higher water quality. This higher water quality, in turn, is associated with a lower probability of cholera contraction (64% vs. 47%). Therefore, clean water does not directly increase the chance of cholera contraction; rather, it is the local water company that is associated with both higher water quality and lower probability of cholera contraction.<|eot_id|>",
