The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 55%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 17%. For children with intelligent parents, would it be more likely to see being lactose intolerant if the child had unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The parents' intelligence only affects the child's probability of being lactose intolerant through its effect on the child's social status, which in turn affects the child's probability of being lactose intolerant. Since the child already has intelligent parents, the child's social status is likely to be higher, which would reduce the child's probability of being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
