The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Method 1: We look directly at how drinking coffee correlates with broken bones in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to hospitalization status. To understand how drinking coffee affects broken bones, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the direct relationship between coffee consumption and hospitalization status, as well as the direct relationship between broken bones and hospitalization status, are separate and distinct from the relationship between coffee consumption and broken bones. In this world, the hospitalization status acts as a confounding variable that needs to be accounted for when examining the relationship between coffee consumption and broken bones. Method 1 would not control for this confounding variable, leading to biased results. In contrast, Method 2 involves examining the relationship between coffee consumption and broken bones within subgroups based on hospitalization status, which allows for proper control of the confounding variable and more accurate causal inference.||",
