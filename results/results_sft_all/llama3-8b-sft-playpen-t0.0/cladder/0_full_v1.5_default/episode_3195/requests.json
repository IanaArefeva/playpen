The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of dark room is 51%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of dark room is 93%. For people who like spicy food, would it be less likely to see dark room if the person did not like spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The additional condition of not liking spicy food does not change the direct effect of the candle on the room, which remains a separate and distinct causal relationship. The probability of a dark room for people who like spicy food is still 93%, and this is not affected by their disliking of spicy food.<|eot_id|>",
