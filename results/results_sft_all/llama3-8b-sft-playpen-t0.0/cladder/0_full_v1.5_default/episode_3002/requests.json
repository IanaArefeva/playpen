Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes sufficient vitamin C, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes no scurvy.

If citrus is absent, then the direct cause of vitamin C is also absent, and since the direct cause of scurvy is the absence of vitamin C, the absence of citrus would lead to the absence of vitamin C, and in turn, lead to scurvy. The patient would not recover from scurvy in this scenario.<|eot_id|>",
