The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and penguin survival. Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 10%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin death is 64%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin death is 25%. Is penguin death more likely than penguin lives overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of penguin lives is 1 - 0.6335 = 0.3665. Since 0.3665 is less than 0.5, penguin death is more likely than penguin lives overall.||",
