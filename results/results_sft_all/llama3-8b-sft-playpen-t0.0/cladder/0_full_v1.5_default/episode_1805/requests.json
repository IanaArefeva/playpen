Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 10%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin death is 64%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin death is 25%. Is penguin death more likely than penguin lives overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of taking the elevator is 10%, the overall probability of penguin death is (0.1 * 0.25) + (0.9 * 0.64) = 0.0575 + 0.576 = 0.6335. The probability of penguin lives is 1 - 0.6335 = 0.3665. Since 0.3665 is less than 0.5, penguin death is more likely than penguin lives overall.<|eot_id|>",
