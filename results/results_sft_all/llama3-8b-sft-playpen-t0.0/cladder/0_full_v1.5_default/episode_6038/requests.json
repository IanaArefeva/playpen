The direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition is that having a sister leads to a healthy heart. If the person does not have a sister, this direct relationship is disrupted, and the person is more likely to have a heart condition. The intermediate relationship between having a sister and heart condition is that having a sister leads to high blood pressure, which in turn leads to a heart condition. If the person does not have a sister, this intermediate relationship is also disrupted, and the person is more likely to have a heart condition.<|eot_id|>",
