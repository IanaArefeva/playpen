The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how parents' intelligence correlates with child's intelligence case by case according to parents' social status. Method 2: We look directly at how parents' intelligence correlates with child's intelligence in general. To understand how parents' intelligence affects child's intelligence, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that parents' social status is not only a function of their intelligence, but also of these unobserved factors. If we look at the relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence in general (Method 2), we will likely overestimate the direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence, as we are not controlling for the unobserved factors that also influence child's intelligence. In contrast, if we condition on parents' social status (Method 1), we can separate the direct effect of parents' intelligence from the unobserved factors that also affect child's intelligence. This is because parents' social status is a direct function of their intelligence, and we can control for this relationship when looking at the relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
