The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 43%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 44%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 76%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 16%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 55%. The overall probability of smoking is 48%. Will smoking increase the chance of being allergic to peanuts?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship is between smoke (or rather, the condition of being a smoker) and the probability of having a high tar deposit, and between the condition of having a high tar deposit and the probability of being allergic to peanuts. The probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher for both smokers and those with a high tar deposit, but this does not imply that the increase in the probability of being allergic to peanuts is due to the direct effect of smoking. The increase in the probability of being allergic to peanuts among smokers is likely due to the higher probability of having a high tar deposit among smokers, which in turn leads to a higher probability of being allergic to peanuts.||",
