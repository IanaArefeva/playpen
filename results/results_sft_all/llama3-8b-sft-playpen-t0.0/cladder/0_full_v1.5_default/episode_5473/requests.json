Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 53%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 74%.

The only direct relationships are between card game play and long lifespan, and between diabetes and long lifespan. Since the direct relationship between card game play and long lifespan is positive, and there is no direct relationship between card game play and diabetes, we conclude that card game play will not decrease the chance of long lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
