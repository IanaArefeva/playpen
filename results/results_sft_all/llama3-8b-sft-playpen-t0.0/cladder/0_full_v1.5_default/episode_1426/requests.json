The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 17%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 60%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 30%. Is normal infant birth weight more likely than low infant birth weight overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of a smoking mother is 17%, we can calculate the overall probability of normal infant birth weight as follows: (1 - 0.17) * 0.6 + 0.17 * 0.3 = 0.54. The probability of normal infant birth weight is less than 50%, which is the same as the probability of low infant birth weight (1 - 0.54 = 0.46).<|eot_id|>",
