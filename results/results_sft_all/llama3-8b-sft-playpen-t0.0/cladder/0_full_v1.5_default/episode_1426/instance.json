Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 17%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 60%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 30%. Is normal infant birth weight more likely than low infant birth weight overall?",
