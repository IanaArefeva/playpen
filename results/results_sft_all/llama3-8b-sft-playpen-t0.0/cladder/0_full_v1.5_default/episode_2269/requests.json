The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 13%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 86%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 46%. Is intelligent child less likely than unintelligent child overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of an intelligent child is the weighted average of these two scenarios, which is (0.13 * 0.46) + (0.87 * 0.86) = 0.73, higher than the probability of an unintelligent child, which is 1 - 0.73 = 0.27.<|eot_id|>",
