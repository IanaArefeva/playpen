The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 13%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 86%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 46%. Is intelligent child less likely than unintelligent child overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
