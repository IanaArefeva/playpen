The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 57%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 62%. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of having a sister is 61%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of having a sister is 28%. Will having a sister increase the chance of low cholesterol?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The unobserved confounder has a direct effect on both having a sister and cholesterol level, which means that the relationship between having a sister and cholesterol level is likely being influenced by this unobserved confounder. In other words, the observed relationship between having a sister and cholesterol level is likely being confounded by the unobserved confounder.<|eot_id|>",
