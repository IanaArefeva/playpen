The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on rainfall. Sprinkler has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of rainy season is 90%. The probability of dry season and high rainfall is 5%. The probability of rainy season and high rainfall is 46%. Is the chance of high rainfall larger when observing rainy season?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of a rainy season is 90%, the overall probability of high rainfall is (0.9 * 0.46) + (0.1 * 0.05) = 0.4145. In a dry season, the probability of high rainfall is 0.05. The chance of high rainfall is larger when observing a dry season than when observing a rainy season.<|eot_id|>",
