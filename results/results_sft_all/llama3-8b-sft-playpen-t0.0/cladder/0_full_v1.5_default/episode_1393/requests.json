Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 74%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The intervening variable of tar deposit does not change the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer; rather, it acts as a bridge between the two. Since the person is already a smoker, the additional information about their past behavior as a nonsmoker does not reduce the likelihood of lung cancer, which remains higher than that of a typical nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
