The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. We know that speaking english and smoker causes having diabetes. speaking english or smoker or having diabetes causes long lifespan. We observed the person is a nonsmoker. Would the person has a short lifespan if speaking english instead of not speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we also know that speaking English is a direct cause of having diabetes, we can conclude that speaking English is a direct cause of having diabetes, which in turn is a direct cause of short lifespan. This chain of causality means that the person's short lifespan is not due to their language skills, but rather to their condition of having diabetes.||",
