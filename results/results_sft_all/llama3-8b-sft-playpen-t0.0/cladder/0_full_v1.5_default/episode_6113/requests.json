Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. We know that having visited England and high skill level causes white-collar job. having visited England and high skill level and white-collar job causes high salary.

If they had not visited England, their occupation might still be white-collar (since having a high skill level already places them in that category), and their salary would likely be high as well, given their skill level. The direct relationship between having a white-collar job and a high salary is not dependent on having visited England, so we can conclude that the person's salary would still be high if they had not visited England.<|eot_id|>",
