The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Vaccination status has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. We know that vaccination causes having smallpox and severe vaccination reaction. having smallpox or severe vaccination reaction causes smallpox survival. Would the person survives smallpox if lack of vaccination instead of vaccination?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
