The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. We know that college degree or higher causes high skill level, and we know that high skill level causes low salary. Would the employee has a high salary if high school degree or lower instead of college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If we consider the opposite condition - having a high school degree or lower - we can conclude that this condition is associated with a lower skill level. Since there is no direct relationship between high school degree or lower and salary, we must consider the relationships through the intermediate variable, skill. A lower skill level is associated with a higher salary, so having a high school degree or lower would lead to a higher salary.||",
