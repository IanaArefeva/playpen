The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 15%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and freckles is 19%. The probability of smoking mother and freckles is 9%. Is the chance of freckles smaller when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between birth weight and freckles is also positive, meaning that higher birth weight is associated with higher probability of freckles. Since the probability of smoking is higher than the probability of having freckles, and the direct relationship between smoking and freckles is positive, we can conclude that the chance of freckles is not smaller when observing a smoking mother.||",
