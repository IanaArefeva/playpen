The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 29%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 33%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of clean water is 83%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of clean water is 68%. Will clean water decrease the chance of cholera contraction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the type of water company (local or global) is a confounding variable that affects both water quality and the probability of cholera contraction. The observed differences in cholera contraction probability between local and global water company users can be attributed to the differences in water quality rather than a direct effect of the water company type on cholera.<|eot_id|>",
