The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. We know that male gender causes non-competitive department. male gender or competitive department causes being allergic to peanuts. Would the applicant is allergic to peanuts if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If we consider a world where the only difference is that the person is not male (hence, a non-male), we must examine the chain of cause and effect. The direct link between male gender and being in a competitive department still holds, and this competitive department still exerts its direct effect on the likelihood of having a peanut allergy. Since the chain of cause and effect remains unbroken, we conclude that the person is still likely to be allergic to peanuts, and the change in gender does not disrupt this chain of cause and effect.||",
