Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 35%. The probability of vaccine refusal and being lactose intolerant is 40%. The probability of getting the vaccine and being lactose intolerant is 9%.

The direct relationship between \"vaccination\" and \"lactose intolerance\" is that the vaccine can reduce the likelihood of being lactose intolerant. This means that if someone is vaccinated, they are less likely to be lactose intolerant.\n2. The probability of being both vaccinated and lactose intolerant is 9%, which is lower than the probability of being vaccine-refused and lactose intolerant (40%).\n3. The probability of being vaccine-refused and lactose intolerant is higher than the probability of being both vaccinated and lactose intolerant, which further supports the idea that being vaccine-refused is associated with a higher likelihood of being lactose intolerant.\n4. The direct relationship between \"pre-conditions\" and \"vaccination\" is that the pre-conditions can lead to a higher likelihood of being vaccinated, which in turn can reduce the likelihood of being lactose intolerant.\n5. The probability of being vaccine-refused and lactose intolerant is higher than the probability of being both vaccinated and lactose intolerant, which further supports the idea that being vaccine-refused is associated with a higher likelihood of being lactose intolerant.\n6. The direct relationship between \"pre-conditions\" and \"lactose intolerance\" is that the pre-conditions can lead to a higher likelihood of being lactose intolerant.\n7.
