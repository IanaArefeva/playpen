Effort has a direct effect on freckles. Method 1: We look directly at how smoking correlates with freckles in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to effort. To understand how smoking affects freckles, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the relationship between smoking and freckles is not direct but rather mediated by effort. If we look at the general correlation between smoking and freckles (Method 1), we would likely find a spurious relationship that doesn't reveal the true causal structure. In contrast, looking at the relationship between smoking and freckles case by case according to effort (Method 2) would allow us to control for the intervening variable and directly observe the effect of smoking on freckles, which is the correct measure of the causal relationship we want to study.<|eot_id|>",
