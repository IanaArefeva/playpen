Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. We know that old age causes low hospital bill. old age and high hospital bill causes recovery. We observed the patient is old.

Since we have a direct effect of hospital costs on recovery, and hospital costs are directly related to the hospital bill, we can conclude that the patient's hospital bill is likely to be low. With a high hospital bill being a cause of recovery, and the patient having a likely low hospital bill, we can conclude that the patient is not likely to recover.<|eot_id|>",
