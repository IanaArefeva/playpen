Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. We know that vaccination causes having smallpox and severe vaccination reaction. having smallpox and severe vaccination reaction causes smallpox survival. Would the person survives smallpox if lack of vaccination instead of vaccination?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since having smallpox directly leads to smallpox survival, the person would still likely to survive smallpox in the absence of vaccination.<|eot_id|>",
