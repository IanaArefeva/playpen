Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 1%. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 75%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 56%. Is healthy heart less likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In both scenarios, the probability of a heart condition is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 (for those taking medication) and 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 (for those not taking medication), which is the same as the probability of a heart condition in the entire population. The medication does not change the overall probability of heart condition; it only shifts the distribution of heart condition between those taking medication and those not.<|eot_id|>",
