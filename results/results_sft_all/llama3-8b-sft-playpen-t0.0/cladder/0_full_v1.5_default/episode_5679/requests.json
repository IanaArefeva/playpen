Having a brother has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of having a brother is 53%. The probability of not having a brother and recovering from the disease is 9%. The probability of having a brother and recovering from the disease is 32%. Is the chance of recovering from the disease smaller when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of disease is higher when you have a brother (32% with a brother, 9% without a brother), which means that having a brother is associated with a higher risk of disease. The direct relationship between having a brother and disease does not imply that the chance of recovering from the disease is smaller when you have a brother. In fact, the probability of recovering from the disease is higher when you have a brother (32% with a brother, 9% without a brother), which means that having a brother is associated with a higher chance of recovery from the disease.<|eot_id|>",
