The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 99%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 77%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 26%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 9%. The overall probability of male gender is 47%. Will receives treatment decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of not male and not receiving treatment is 53% (not male) * 99% (not male and not treatment) = 52.47%. The probability of not male and receiving treatment is 53% (not male) * 77% (not male and treatment) = 40.81%. The probability of male and not receiving treatment is 47% (male) * 26% (male and not treatment) = 12.22%. The probability of male and receiving treatment is 47% (male) * 9% (male and treatment) = 4.23%. The overall probability of not male and not treatment is 52.47% and the overall probability of male and not treatment is 12.22%. The difference between the two is 40.25%. The overall probability of not male and treatment is 40.81% and the overall probability of male and treatment is 4.23%. The difference between the two is 36.58%. The difference between the two differences is 3.67%. The difference between the two differences is less than the difference between the two, which means that the probability of male and not treatment is less than the probability of not male and not treatment, and the probability of male and treatment is less than the probability of not male and treatment. This means that the probability of",
