Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 91%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 75%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 40%. Is scurvy less likely than no scurvy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of citrus consumption is 91%, we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of scurvy. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event E is the sum of the products of the probability of E given each cause C and the probability of C. In this case, the probability of scurvy is the sum of the products of the probability of scurvy given citrus consumption (40%) and the probability of citrus consumption (91%), and the probability of scurvy given no citrus consumption (75%) and the probability of no citrus consumption (9%). The law of total probability can be represented as: P(scurvy) = P(scurvy|citrus)P(citrus) + P(scurvy|no citrus)P(no citrus) = 0.4(0.91) + 0.75(0.09) = 0.364 + 0.0675 = 0.4315. The probability of no scurvy is 1 - 0.4315 = 0.5685. Since 0.5685 is greater than 0.4315, scurvy is less likely than no scurvy overall.<|eot_id|>",
