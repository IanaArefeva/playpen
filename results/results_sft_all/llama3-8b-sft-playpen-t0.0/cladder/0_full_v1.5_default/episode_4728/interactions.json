The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of having visited England is 19%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of the prisoner's death is 32%. For people who have visited England, the probability of the prisoner's death is 75%. Is the prisoner's death less likely than the prisoner being alive overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the probability of the prisoner's death is higher for those who have visited England than for those who have not. Since the probability of having visited England is 19%, the overall probability of the prisoner's death is a weighted average of the two probabilities, which is higher than the probability of the prisoner being alive.||",
