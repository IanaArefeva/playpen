The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 6%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 49%. Will encouragement increase the chance of high exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of studying habits on exam score is also positive, meaning that higher studying habits should lead to higher exam scores. The counterfactuals in the table, which show the exam score probability for students who are not encouraged, further support this conclusion. If encouragement were to increase the chance of a high exam score, we would see a higher exam score probability for students who are not encouraged compared to those who are not. Since this is not the case, we can conclude that encouragement does not increase the chance of a high exam score.<|eot_id|>",
