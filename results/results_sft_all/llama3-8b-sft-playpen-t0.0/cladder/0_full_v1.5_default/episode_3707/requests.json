Skill has a direct effect on black hair. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 47%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 66%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be more likely to see black hair if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that having a college degree or higher directly increases the likelihood of black hair. If we condition on having a college degree or higher, the absence of a college degree does not reduce the probability of black hair; rather, it remains at 66%.<|eot_id|>",
