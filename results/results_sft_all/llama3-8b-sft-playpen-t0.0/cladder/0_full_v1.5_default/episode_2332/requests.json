The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 91%. The probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 7%. The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 58%. Is the chance of long lifespan smaller when observing obesity?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of obesity is 91%, and the probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 7%, we can conclude that the positive direct effect of obesity on lifespan must be strong enough to counteract the negative direct effect of diabetes on lifespan. This is because the probability of obesity and long lifespan is 58%, which is higher than the probability of normal weight and long lifespan (7%). This suggests that the positive direct effect of obesity on lifespan is strong enough to offset the negative direct effect of diabetes on lifespan, leading to a higher chance of long lifespan when observing obesity.<|eot_id|>",
