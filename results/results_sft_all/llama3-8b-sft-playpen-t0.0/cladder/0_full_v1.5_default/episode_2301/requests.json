Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 91%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 65%. Will smoking decrease the chance of college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The reduction in probability is a direct result of the negative effect of smoking on college admission. The positive effect of effort on college admission counteracts the negative direct effect of smoking, leading to a higher probability of college admission for those who smoke and put in more effort than those who do not smoke.<|eot_id|>",
