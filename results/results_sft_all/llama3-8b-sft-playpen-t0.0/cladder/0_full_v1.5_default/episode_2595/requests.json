The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 69%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 3%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 72%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 19%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 69%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 18%. The overall probability of smoking is 70%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than that among nonsmokers in both the no tar and high tar scenarios. This counterintuitive finding can be explained by the intervening variable of tar deposit. The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is fully mediated by the intervening variable of tar deposit. Smoking directly affects the probability of high tar deposit, which in turn affects the probability of lung cancer. The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not as strong as it might appear, and the intervening variable of tar deposit plays a crucial role in this relationship.<|eot_id|>",
