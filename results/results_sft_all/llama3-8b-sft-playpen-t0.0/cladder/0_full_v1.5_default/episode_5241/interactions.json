The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of male gender is 6%. The probability of non-male gender and being lactose intolerant is 53%. The probability of male gender and being lactose intolerant is 1%. Is the chance of being lactose intolerant smaller when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
