Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 71%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 10%. For husbands that set the alarm, would it be more likely to see ringing alarm if the husband had not set the alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If a husband sets the alarm, the probability of the alarm clock ringing is lower than if he doesn't set the alarm. This indicates that setting the alarm has a negative effect on the probability of the alarm clock ringing.<|eot_id|>",
