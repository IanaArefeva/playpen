Treatment has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of receives treatment is 40%. The probability of receives no treatment and being allergic to peanuts is 26%. The probability of receives treatment and being allergic to peanuts is 24%. Is the chance of being allergic to peanuts smaller when observing receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the absence of treatment is associated with a higher risk of being allergic to peanuts, rather than the opposite.<|eot_id|>",
