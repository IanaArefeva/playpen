The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 6%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 31%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 85%. Is large feet less likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since both tanning salon treatment and beach activities lead to larger foot size, we can conclude that large feet are more likely than small feet in this world.<|eot_id|>",
