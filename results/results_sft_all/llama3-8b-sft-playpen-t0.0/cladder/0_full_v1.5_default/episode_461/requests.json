Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 88%. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 59%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 49%. Is healthy heart more likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a person having a heart condition is 1 - 0.49 = 0.51 when they take medication and 1 - 0.59 = 0.41 when they do not take medication. Since the probability of a person taking medication is 0.88, the overall probability of a person having a heart condition is 0.88 * 0.51 + 0.12 * 0.41 = 0.46. The probability of a person having a heart condition is less than the probability of a person having a heart condition when they take medication (0.51), and it is also less than the probability of a person having a heart condition when they do not take medication (0.41), which is the same as the probability of a person having a heart condition when they take medication (0.51).<|eot_id|>",
