The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 26%. For people who have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 68%. Will having a sister increase the chance of the prisoner's death?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The corporal and the private have direct effects on the prisoner, but the relationship between having a sister and the probability of the prisoner's death is not established through these intermediate variables. The given information only shows that having a sister is associated with a higher probability of the prisoner's death (68% vs. 26%), but this association does not imply causation.||",
