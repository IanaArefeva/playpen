The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. We know that smoking mother and good health causes normal infant birth weight. smoking mother or good health or normal infant birth weight causes high infant mortality. We observed the person has good health. Would infant mortality is high if nonsmoking mother instead of smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the person has good health, we can conclude that the birth weight is normal. A normal birth weight directly affects infant mortality, and since the person has good health, we can conclude that the birth weight is normal, which in turn means that the infant mortality is not high. The smoking status of the mother is not directly related to the person's health condition, so we can conclude that the person's health condition is the primary factor determining the birth weight and, through it, the infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
