The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 8%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 54%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 90%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of Alice waking up on time is 1 - 0.08 = 0.92. The probability of Alice arriving on time given that she wakes up on time is 0.54. The probability of Alice arriving on time given that she wakes up late is 0.90. The probability of Alice facing traffic is not directly given, but we can still proceed with the available information. The probability of Alice facing traffic is not directly given, so we will consider the two scenarios where she does and does not face traffic. If she faces traffic, the probability of her arriving on time is the same as if she wakes up late, which is 0.90. If she does not face traffic, the probability of her arriving on time is the same as if she wakes up on time, which is 0.54. The probability of facing traffic is not directly given, so we will consider the two scenarios where she does and does not face traffic. If she faces traffic, the probability of her arriving on time is the same as if she wakes up late, which is 0.90. If she does not face traffic, the probability of her arriving on time is the same as if she wakes up on time, which is 0.54. The probability of facing traffic is not directly",
