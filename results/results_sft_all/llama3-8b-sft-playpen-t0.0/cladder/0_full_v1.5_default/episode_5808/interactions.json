The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how having a brother correlates with lung cancer in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to smoking. To understand how having a brother affects lung cancer, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If we look at the general correlation between having a brother and lung cancer (Method 1), we would be confounding the direct effect of having a brother on lung cancer through its effect on smoking. In other words, we would be double counting the effect of having a brother on lung cancer. Method 2, on the other hand, controls for the intervening variable of smoking, providing a more accurate measure of the direct effect of having a brother on lung cancer.||",
