The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 50%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of brown eyes is 42%. For individuals who are male, the probability of brown eyes is 49%. Is brown eyes less likely than blue eyes overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of male gender is 50%, this means that half of the population has a higher probability of brown eyes than the other half. The direct relationship between brown eyes and department competitiveness further solidifies this association, as it indicates that brown eyes are more likely in more competitive departments, which are likely to have more male staff. Finally, the direct relationship between male gender and brown eyes directly shows that male staff are more likely to have brown eyes than their female counterparts.||",
