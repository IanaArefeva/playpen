Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 42%. For children who like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 56%.

The direct effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence is also positive, which further supports the idea that children from higher social status families are more likely to be intelligent. Since the direct effect of liking spicy food on child's intelligence is positive and parents' social status has a direct positive effect on child's intelligence, we can conclude that liking spicy food will not decrease the chance of an intelligent child.<|eot_id|>",
