Since the person is far from a college, the only direct effect on their coffee consumption is through the unobserved confounder, which is active. The person's coffee consumption is determined by the active confounder, which is not directly related to their salary. The direct effect of coffee consumption on salary is also absent in this case, as the person is far from a college. The only remaining direct effect is through the active confounder, which is not directly related to the person's coffee consumption. Since the person is far from a college and the direct effect of coffee consumption on their salary is absent, we conclude that the person would not have a high salary if they drank coffee instead of not drinking coffee.<|eot_id|>",
