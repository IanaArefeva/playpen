The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 34%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 12%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 52%. Is normal infant birth weight more likely than low infant birth weight overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of a mother being a smoker is 34%, we can use this information to calculate the overall probability of normal birth weight. The probability of a normal birth weight for an infant with a smoking mother is 0.34 * 0.52 = 0.1772, and the probability of a normal birth weight for an infant with a nonsmoking mother is 0.66 * 0.12 = 0.0792. The total probability of a normal birth weight is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.1772 + 0.0792 = 0.2564. The probability of a normal birth weight is less than 0.5, which means that normal birth weight is not more likely than low birth weight overall.||",
