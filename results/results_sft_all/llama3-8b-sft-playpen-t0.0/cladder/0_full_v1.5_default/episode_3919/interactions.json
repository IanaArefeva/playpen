The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 6%. For individuals who have not visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 40%. For individuals who have visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 36%. For individuals who have visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 68%. For individuals who have not visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 26%. For individuals who have not visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 11%. For individuals who have visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 57%. For individuals who have visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 67%. The overall probability of high skill level is 19%. Does having visited England positively affect salary through occupation?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key insight here is that the positive effect of having visited England on salary is primarily through white-collar occupation, which already has a higher probability of high salary (40%) compared to blue-collar occupation (6%). The increase in the probability of white-collar occupation among those who have visited England (57% for those with low skill and 67% for those with high skill) further solidifies this relationship. The direct relationship between having visited England and white-collar occupation is not the primary cause of the positive effect on salary; rather, it is the white-collar occupation that directly affects the probability of a high salary.||",
