The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how having a sister correlates with infant mortality case by case according to infant's birth weight. Method 2: We look directly at how having a sister correlates with infant mortality in general. To understand how having a sister affects infant mortality, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the relationship between having a sister and infant mortality is confounded by birth weight. If we look at the relationship between having a sister and infant mortality case by case according to birth weight (Method 1), we are still subject to confounding by birth weight, which is a direct cause of both having a sister and infant mortality. In other words, birth weight acts as a bridge variable that conveys the effect of having a sister on infant mortality, and looking at the relationship case by case does not eliminate this bridge variable. In contrast, looking at the general relationship between having a sister and infant mortality (Method 2) still conveys the direct effect of having a sister on infant mortality, without the bridge variable of birth weight intervening.<|eot_id|>",
