The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. Method 1: We look at how drinking coffee correlates with room case by case according to the candle. Method 2: We look directly at how drinking coffee correlates with room in general. To understand how drinking coffee affects room, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the absence of any unmentioned factors or additional relationships, the direct measure of the relationship between coffee consumption and room state (Method 2) is more reliable and less subject to bias than the case-by-case measure that involves an intermediate variable (Method 1).||",
