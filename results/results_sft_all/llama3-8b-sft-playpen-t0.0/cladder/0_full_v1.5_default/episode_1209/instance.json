  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 62%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 31%. For infants with smoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 96%. For infants with smoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 60%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 81%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 76%. For infants with smoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 33%. For infants with smoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 42%. The overall probability of good health is 45%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would maternal smoking status positively affect infant mortality?",
