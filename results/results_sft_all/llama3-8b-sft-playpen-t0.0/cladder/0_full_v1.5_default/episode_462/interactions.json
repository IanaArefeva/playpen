The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 24%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 69%. Will taking medication decrease the chance of healthy heart?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of blood pressure on heart condition is also positive, meaning higher blood pressure is associated with a lower chance of a healthy heart. Since medication directly affects heart condition and blood pressure is an intermediate variable that also affects heart condition, we need to consider the joint effect of medication and blood pressure on heart condition. If medication reduces blood pressure, then its positive direct effect on heart condition could still lead to an overall increase in the probability of a healthy heart.||",
