The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The camper has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of the camper lighting a match is 22%. For campers who do not light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 27%. For campers who light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 60%. Is the forest on fire less likely than the forest not on fire overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the forest on fire is higher than the probability of the forest not on fire, so the forest is more likely to be on fire than not on fire overall.<|eot_id|>",
