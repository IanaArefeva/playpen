The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on rainfall. Sprinkler has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of rainy season is 98%. The probability of dry season and high rainfall is 1%. The probability of rainy season and high rainfall is 37%. Is the chance of high rainfall larger when observing rainy season?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the chance of high rainfall is not larger when observing a rainy season.<|eot_id|>",
