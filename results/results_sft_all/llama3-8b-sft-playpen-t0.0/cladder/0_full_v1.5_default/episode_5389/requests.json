The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how parents' intelligence correlates with lactose intolerance in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to parents' social status. To understand how parents' intelligence affects lactose intolerance, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If we look at the general correlation between parents' intelligence and lactose intolerance (Method 1), we will likely find a spurious relationship due to the confounding effect of social status. In other words, parents with higher social status are more likely to have higher intelligence and lower lactose intolerance, but this does not imply that higher intelligence directly causes lower lactose intolerance. To disentangle the causal relationships, we need to control for the confounding variable social status by looking at the correlation case by case (Method 2). This approach allows us to see whether there is a direct relationship between parents' intelligence and lactose intolerance, independent of social status.<|eot_id|>",
