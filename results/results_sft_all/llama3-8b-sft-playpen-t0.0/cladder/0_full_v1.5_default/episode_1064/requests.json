The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 45%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 60%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 26%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of treatment is 45%, and the probability of non-treatment is 55%. The joint probability of not receiving treatment and not recovering is 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16. The joint probability of not receiving treatment and recovering is 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24. The joint probability of not being in the treatment arm and not recovering is 0.16. The joint probability of not being in the treatment arm and recovering is 0.24. The joint probability of being in the treatment arm and not recovering is 0.45 * 0.74 = 0.333. The joint probability of being in the treatment arm and recovering is 0.45 * 0.26 = 0.117. The total probability of not recovering is 0.16 + 0.333 = 0.49. The total probability of recovering is 0.24 + 0.117 = 0.357. Since the total probability of not recovering (0.49) is greater than the total probability of recovering (0.357), we conclude that non-recovery is more likely than recovery overall.<|eot_id|>",
