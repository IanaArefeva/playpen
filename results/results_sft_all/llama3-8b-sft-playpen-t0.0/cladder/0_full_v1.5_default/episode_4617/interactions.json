The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 89%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 58%. For people who drink coffee, would it be less likely to see dark room if the person did not drink coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of dark room is determined by the direct effect of the candle on room, which is not influenced by whether the person drinks coffee. The probability of dark room is also not directly related to the person's behavior of not drinking coffee. The only thing that affects the probability of dark room is the direct effect of the candle on room, which remains the same whether the person drinks coffee or not.||",
