The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 38%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 44%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 28%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 51%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is counterintuitive and likely due to the unobserved confounder that affects both maternal smoking and birth weight. The unobserved confounder likely has a positive effect on birth weight and a negative effect on smoking behavior, which is why we see a positive relationship between smoking and birth weight in this setting.||",
