Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 98%. For students who are not talented, the probability of being hard-working is 96%. For students who are talented, the probability of being hard-working is 96%. Is being hard-working less likely than being lazy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being talented is 98%, the overall probability of being hard-working is also 98% (0.98 * 0.96 + 0.02 * 0.96 = 0.98). In this world, being hard-working is not less likely than being lazy overall; in fact, being hard-working is more likely than being lazy.<|eot_id|>",
