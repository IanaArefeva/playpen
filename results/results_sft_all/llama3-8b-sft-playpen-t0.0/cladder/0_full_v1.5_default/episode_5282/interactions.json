The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who do not like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 70%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 48%. For individuals who like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 44%. For individuals who like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 17%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 74%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 45%. For individuals who like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 49%. For individuals who like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 18%. The overall probability of high skill level is 95%. If we disregard the mediation effect through occupation, would liking spicy food negatively affect salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key relationship is between occupation and salary, which is direct and positive. The direct relationship between skill and occupation is also positive. The direct relationship between skill and salary is not directly quantified, but we can infer its sign based on the given relationships. The direct relationship between liking spicy food and skill is not quantified, but we can conclude that it is positive since the probability of white-collar job is higher for those who like spicy food than for those who do not, and the probability of high salary is higher for those who like spicy food than for those who do not, in both blue-collar and white-collar groups. The direct relationship between occupation and skill is not quantified, but we can conclude that it is positive since the probability of white-collar job is higher for those with high skill than for those with low skill, in both groups who like and do not like spicy food.
