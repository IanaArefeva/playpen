Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 8%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 30%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 84%.

Since the probability of tanning salon treatment is 8%, we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of tanned skin. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event E is the sum of the products of the probability of E given each cause C and the probability of C. In this case, the probability of tanned skin is the sum of the products of the probability of tanned skin given tanning salon treatment (84%) and the probability of tanning salon treatment (8%), and the probability of tanned skin given no tanning salon treatment (30%) and the probability of no tanning salon treatment (92%). The law of total probability can be represented as: P(tanned skin) = P(tanned skin|tanning salon)P(tanning salon) + P(tanned skin|no tanning salon)P(no tanning salon) = (84%)(8%) + (30%)(92%) = 0.672 + 0.276 = 0.948. The probability of tanned skin is 94.8%, and the probability of pale skin is 5.2%. Since 94.8% is greater than 5.2%, tanned skin is more likely than pale skin.<|eot_id|>",
