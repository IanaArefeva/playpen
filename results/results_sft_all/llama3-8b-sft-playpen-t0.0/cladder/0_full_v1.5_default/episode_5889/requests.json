The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a brother and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Having a brother has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a brother is 31%. For infants who do not have a brother, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 5%. For infants who have a brother, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 38%. Is normal infant birth weight more likely than low infant birth weight overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of having a brother is 31%, the overall probability of normal birth weight is (0.31 * 0.38) + (0.69 * 0.05) = 0.1183 + 0.0345 = 0.1528, which is less than 0.5, the probability of normal birth weight being more likely than not.<|eot_id|>",
