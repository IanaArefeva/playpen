The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 79%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 81%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 41%. Is arriving to school on time less likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of Alice waking up on time is 1 - 0.79 = 0.21. The probability of Alice waking up on time and then arriving on time is 0.21 * 0.81 = 0.1701. The probability of Alice waking up late is 0.79. The probability of Alice waking up late and still arriving on time is 0.79 * 0.41 = 0.3239. The total probability of Alice arriving to school on time is 0.1701 + 0.3239 = 0.494. The probability of Alice arriving to school late is 1 - 0.494 = 0.506. Since 0.494 is less than 0.506, the probability of Alice arriving to school on time is less than the probability of Alice arriving to school late.||",
