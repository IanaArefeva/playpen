The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 1%. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 49%. For people who drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 44%. For people who drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 90%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 82%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 78%. Does drinking coffee negatively affect alarm clock through wife?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing when the person drinks coffee and the wife sets the alarm is 90%, which is higher than the 49% probability when the person does not drink coffee and the wife sets the alarm. This suggests that coffee consumption might have a positive effect on the probability of the alarm clock ringing through the wife.||",
