Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives no treatment. large kidney stone and receives treatment causes recovery. We observed the patient has a small kidney stone. Would the patient does recover if receives no treatment instead of receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the patient has a small kidney stone, we can conclude that the patient will likely receive treatment. The direct relationship between treatment and recovery is that treatment leads to recovery. Since the patient will likely receive treatment, we can conclude that the patient will likely recover. If the patient were to receive no treatment instead of treatment, we would not have a direct relationship between no treatment and recovery, and we would not be able to conclude that the patient would likely recover.<|eot_id|>",
