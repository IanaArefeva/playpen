The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drug taken and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on drug taken. Drug taken has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how drug taken correlates with cholesterol level case by case according to unobserved confounders. Method 2: We look directly at how drug taken correlates with cholesterol level in general. To understand how drug taken affects cholesterol level, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key issue is the unobserved confounder that affects both drug taken and cholesterol level. Method 1 involves looking at the relationship between drug taken and cholesterol level on a case-by-case basis, which would account for the variations in unobserved confounders. In contrast, Method 2 looks at the general relationship between drug taken and cholesterol level without considering the variations in unobserved confounders. Since the unobserved confounder is unobserved and directly affects both drug taken and cholesterol level, Method 1 is more appropriate for understanding the effect of drug taken on cholesterol level.<|eot_id|>",
