The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. For people not blowing out candles, the probability of dark room is 89%. For people who blow out candles, the probability of dark room is 58%. Will blowing out the candle decrease the chance of dark room?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that, on average, people who blow out candles have a lower chance of a dark room than those who do not. The direct effect of the man on the room is not relevant to the question of whether blowing out the candle will decrease the chance of a dark room. The direct effect of the candle on the room is also not directly relevant, as the question is focused on the man's action of blowing out the candle. The key information is the different probabilities of a dark room associated with and without the action of blowing out the candle.||",
