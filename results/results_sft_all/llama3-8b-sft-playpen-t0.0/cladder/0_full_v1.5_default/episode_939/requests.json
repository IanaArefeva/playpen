The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 82%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 51%. For obese people, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person had been normal weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, the primary risk factor for diabetes is not being normal weight, but rather being either obese or smoking. Since the person is already obese, the additional condition of being normal weight would not directly reduce the risk of diabetes, which is the primary risk factor for a short lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
