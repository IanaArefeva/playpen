The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 6%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 90%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 56%. Is intelligent child less likely than unintelligent child overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of an unintelligent child is the probability of an intelligent child with intelligent parents (0.56) and the probability of an unintelligent child with intelligent parents (0.44), which is 1.
