The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 99%. For patients who have small kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 88%. For patients who have large kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 32%. For patients who have large kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 18%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 59%. For patients who speak english, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The ability to speak English also has a direct effect on recovery, and this effect is not uniform across all groups. In particular, for patients with small kidney stones, the probability of recovery is higher when they speak English (88%) than when they do not (99%). This suggests that the ability to speak English may actually increase the probability of recovery, at least in the case of small kidney stones. If we condition on the patient having a small kidney stone, the probability of recovery is higher when they speak English than when they do not. This means that, in this specific context, not speaking English would not lead to a lower probability of recovery.<|eot_id|>",
