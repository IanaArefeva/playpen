The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 58%. The probability of low hospital bill and recovery is 11%. The probability of high hospital bill and recovery is 41%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing high hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship is between hospital costs and the probability of high hospital bill, which in turn affects the probability of recovery. The given probabilities (58% for high hospital bill, 11% for both low hospital bill and recovery, and 41% for both high hospital bill and recovery) imply that the probability of high hospital bill is higher than the probability of both high hospital bill and recovery. This suggests that the direct relationship between hospital costs and the probability of high hospital bill is more influential than the relationship between hospital costs and the probability of recovery.||",
