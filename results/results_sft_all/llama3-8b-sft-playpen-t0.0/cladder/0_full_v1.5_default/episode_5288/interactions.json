The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who do not like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 65%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 35%. For individuals who like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 53%. For individuals who like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 29%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 70%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 35%. For individuals who like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 74%. For individuals who like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 48%. The overall probability of high skill level is 92%. Does liking spicy food positively affect salary through occupation?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between occupation and salary is clear, but the connection between liking spicy food and occupation is more circuitous. The key insight here is that the probability of white-collar job is higher for those who like spicy food and have either high or low skill levels, which in turn affects the probability of high salary. This suggests that the positive effect of liking spicy food on salary is likely through the skill variable rather than occupation.||",
