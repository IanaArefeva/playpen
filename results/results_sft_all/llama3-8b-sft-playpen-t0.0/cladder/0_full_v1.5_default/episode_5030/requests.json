Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of speaking english is 84%. For people who do not speak english, the probability of talent is 88%. For people who speak english, the probability of talent is 88%.

Since the probability of speaking English is 84%, we can conclude that the overall probability of having talent is also 88%. The probability of lacking talent is then 12% (100% - 88%). Since 16% of the population (100% - 84%) does not speak English, and this group has a 88% probability of having talent, we can conclude that the probability of lacking talent is less than 12% for this group. This means that the overall probability of lacking talent is less than 12%.<|eot_id|>",
