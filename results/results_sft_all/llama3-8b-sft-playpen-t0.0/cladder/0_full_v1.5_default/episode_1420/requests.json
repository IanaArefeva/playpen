The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how maternal smoking status correlates with infant's birth weight in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to unobserved confounders. To understand how maternal smoking status affects infant's birth weight, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is a classic case of confounding bias, where the observed association between the exposure (maternal smoking status) and the outcome (infant's birth weight) is not causal but rather due to the joint effect of the unobserved confounders. Method 1 directly looks at the general correlation between maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight, which would likely reveal a spurious association rather than a causal relationship. In contrast, Method 2 carefully controls for the unobserved confounders by looking at the relationship case by case, which would allow us to isolate the direct effect of maternal smoking status on infant's birth weight. Therefore, it is more correct to use Method 2 than Method 1 to understand the causal relationship between maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight.<|eot_id|>",
