The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 50%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 73%. For people taking medication, would it be more likely to see healthy heart if the person had taken no medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of blood pressure on heart condition is also positive, meaning higher blood pressure is associated with a lower probability of a healthy heart. Since medication directly affects heart condition and blood pressure is an intermediate variable that also affects heart condition, we need to consider the joint effect of medication and blood pressure on heart condition. If a person is taking medication, their heart condition is likely to be healthier than if they were not taking medication. The blood pressure of a person taking medication is still subject to the same positive relationship with heart condition as for those not taking medication. Therefore, it is not more likely to see a healthy heart if the person had taken no medication, as the direct positive effect of medication on heart condition supersedes any potential negative effect of higher blood pressure.||",
