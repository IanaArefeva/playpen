The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. For people not blowing out candles, the probability of dark room is 51%. For people who blow out candles, the probability of dark room is 93%. For people who blow out candles, would it be less likely to see dark room if the person in the room had not blown out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a dark room is 51% for people not blowing out candles and 93% for people who do. The person's action of blowing out the candle directly affects the room's state, and this action is separate from the person's direct effect on the room. The person's direct effect on the room is not dependent on whether they blow out the candle or not. The probability of a dark room is higher when the person blows out the candle, which means that the person's action of blowing out the candle is the primary cause of the room being dark, rather than their direct effect on the room.||",
