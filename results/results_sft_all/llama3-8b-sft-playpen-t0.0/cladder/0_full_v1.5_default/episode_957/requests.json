Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 8%. The probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 63%. The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 3%.

In fact, the probability of having a long lifespan is higher when you have both obesity and long lifespan than when you have only a long lifespan (3% vs 63%).<|eot_id|>",
