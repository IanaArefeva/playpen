The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 14%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and normal infant birth weight is 14%. The probability of smoking mother and normal infant birth weight is 6%. Is the chance of normal infant birth weight smaller when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of normal birth weight is higher in the smoking mother group (6%) than in the non-smoking mother group (14%). This positive relationship between maternal smoking and birth weight suggests that the chance of normal birth weight is not smaller when observing a smoking mother, but rather larger.||",
