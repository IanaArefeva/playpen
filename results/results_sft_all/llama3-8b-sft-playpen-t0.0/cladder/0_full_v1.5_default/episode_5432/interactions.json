The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and freckles. Effort has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of smoking is 87%. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 53%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 39%. Is freckles more likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Additionally, the direct relationship between effort and freckles is that higher effort is associated with a lower probability of freckles. Since the probability of smoking is 87%, the large majority of the population is smokers, and among them, the probability of freckles is lower than among nonsmokers. This suggests that the overall probability of freckles is likely lower than the probability of no freckles, given the higher base rate of smoking and its associated lower probability of freckles.||",
