Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 23%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 71%. For people who went to tanning salons, would it be less likely to see large feet if the person had not had a tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments is 71%, which is higher than the 23% among those who did not use tanning salon treatments. This means that tanning salon treatment directly affects foot size, and this effect is not offset by the separate direct effect of tanning salon treatment on the probability of large feet.<|eot_id|>",
