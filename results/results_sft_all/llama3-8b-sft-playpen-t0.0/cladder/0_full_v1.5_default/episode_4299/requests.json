Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Method 1: We look directly at how vaccination correlates with lactose intolerance in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to pre-conditions. To understand how vaccination affects lactose intolerance, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the effect of vaccination on lactose intolerance is not uniform across all pre-conditions, but rather it is specific to each pre-condition. In other words, the relationship between vaccination and lactose intolerance is not a single, uniform relationship, but rather a set of relationships that vary depending on the specific pre-condition. This is exactly the kind of situation where looking at the relationship case by case, as in Method 2, is more appropriate than looking at the relationship in general, as in Method 1.<|eot_id|>",
