The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Method 1: We look directly at how vaccination correlates with lactose intolerance in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to pre-conditions. To understand how vaccination affects lactose intolerance, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the effect of vaccination on lactose intolerance is not uniform across all pre-conditions, but rather it is specific to each pre-condition. In other words, the relationship between vaccination and lactose intolerance is not a single, uniform relationship, but rather a set of relationships that vary depending on the specific pre-condition. This is exactly the kind of situation where looking at the relationship case by case, as in Method 2, is more appropriate than looking at the relationship in general, as in Method 1.||",
