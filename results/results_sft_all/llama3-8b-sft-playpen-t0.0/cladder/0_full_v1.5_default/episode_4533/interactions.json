The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and brown eyes. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on brown eyes. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 44%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and brown eyes is 46%. The probability of smoking mother and brown eyes is 22%. Is the chance of brown eyes smaller when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between the unobserved confounders and the other variables is also not fully characterized. In this context, we must carefully consider the available information and the structure of the relationships between the variables to make an informed decision.\nThe probability of a smoking mother is 44%, and the probability of a brown eye is 46%. The joint probability of a smoking mother and a brown eye is 22%. This joint probability is less than the product of the individual probabilities of a smoking mother (44%) and a brown eye (46%), which is 0.2024. This suggests that there is a negative interaction between the two variables, meaning that the occurrence of one variable reduces the likelihood of the other.\nHowever, we must also consider the direct relationship between the unobserved confounders and the other variables. The unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both the maternal smoking status and the brown eyes. This means that the unobserved confounders can influence both the likelihood of a brown eye and the likelihood of a smoking mother.\nGiven the above relationships, we can conclude that the chance of brown eyes is not smaller when observing a smoking mother. The joint probability of a smoking mother and a brown eye is lower",
