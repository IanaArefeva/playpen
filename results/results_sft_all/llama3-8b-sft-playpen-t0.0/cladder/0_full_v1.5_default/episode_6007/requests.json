Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that solar eclipse or heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is heavy traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if solar eclipse instead of no solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already have heavy traffic, which directly affects Alice's arrival, the additional condition of solar eclipse does not change the outcome. The separate direct effects of solar eclipse and heavy traffic on Alice's arrival do not compound or cancel each other out; rather, they work independently. In this specific situation, the direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not strong enough to counteract the direct effect of heavy traffic, which already hinders Alice's arrival.<|eot_id|>",
