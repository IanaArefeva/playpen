The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 80%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 54%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 79%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 53%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 40%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 19%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see freckles if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
