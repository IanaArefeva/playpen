Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 91%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 77%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 31%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 20%. The overall probability of old age is 50%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?",
