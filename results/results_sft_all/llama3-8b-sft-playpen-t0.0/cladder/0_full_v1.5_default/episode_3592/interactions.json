The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of having a sister is 82%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 47%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 88%. Is healthy heart more likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having a sister is 82%, which means that 18% of the population does not have a sister. For this 18%, the probability of a healthy heart is 47%. In contrast, for the 82% who do have a sister, the probability of a healthy heart is 88%. To find the overall probability of a healthy heart, we need to consider both groups. The overall probability of a healthy heart is a weighted average of the two groups, with the weight being the fraction of the population in each group. Since 82% of the population has a sister, the weight for this group is 0.82, and the weight for the 18% without a sister is 0.18. The overall probability of a healthy heart is then (0.82 * 0.88) + (0.18 * 0.47) = 0.6974 + 0.0846 = 0.782. The probability of heart problems is 1 - 0.782 = 0.218. Since 0.218 is less than 0.5, heart problems are more likely than a healthy heart overall.||",
