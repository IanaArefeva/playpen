The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 81%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 21%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 86%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
