Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 51%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 47%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 63%. Is admission acceptance more likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Additionally, the direct relationship between department competitiveness and higher probability of admission acceptance further solidifies this positive relationship. Since the probability of male gender is 51%, this means that more than half of the population is male, and as a result, more than half of the population will have a higher probability of admission acceptance. This, in turn, means that the overall probability of admission acceptance is higher than the probability of admission rejection.<|eot_id|>",
