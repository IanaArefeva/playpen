The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. Method 1: We look directly at how having visited England correlates with prisoner in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to the private. To understand how having visited England affects prisoner, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the direct relationship between having visited England and the corporal, and the direct relationship between the corporal and the private, imply that the corporal acts as a mediator between having visited England and the private. Since the direct relationship between the private and the prisoner is also established, we can conclude that the correct method is to examine this relationship case by case according to the private, rather than looking at the general correlation between having visited England and the prisoner.||",
