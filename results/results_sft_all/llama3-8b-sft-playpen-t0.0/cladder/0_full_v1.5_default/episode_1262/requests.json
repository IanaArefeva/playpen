The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 45%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 67%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 30%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 23%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. The overall probability of smoking is 50%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than that among nonsmokers when there is no tar deposit (23% vs. 30%). This suggests that the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer might be counteracted by another factor when there is no tar deposit. The probability of lung cancer among smokers is also lower than that among nonsmokers when there is a high tar deposit (44% vs. 52%). This further blurs the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer. The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is also subject to the intervening effect of tar deposit, which has a direct effect on lung cancer. The probability of high tar deposit is higher among smokers than among nonsmokers (67% vs. 45%), which could lead to a higher probability of lung cancer among smokers than among nonsmokers.<|eot_id|>",
