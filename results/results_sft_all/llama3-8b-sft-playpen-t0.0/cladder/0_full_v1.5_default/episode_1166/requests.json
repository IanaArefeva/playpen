The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. Method 1: We look at how vaccination correlates with disease case by case according to pre-conditions. Method 2: We look directly at how vaccination correlates with disease in general. To understand how vaccination affects disease, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of vaccination on disease is what we want to understand, and looking at the general correlation between vaccination and disease (Method 2) is a more direct and appropriate way to do so. Method 1 involves looking at the relationship between pre-conditions and disease, which is an intermediate step and not directly relevant to the relationship between vaccination and disease.<|eot_id|>",
