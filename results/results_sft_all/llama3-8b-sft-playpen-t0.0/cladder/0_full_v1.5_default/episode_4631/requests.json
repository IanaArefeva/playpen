The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 10%. The probability of not drinking coffee and dark room is 75%. The probability of drinking coffee and dark room is 5%. Is the chance of dark room larger when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of not drinking coffee is 90% (100% - 10% chance of drinking coffee), the overall probability of a dark room is still 75% (0.9 * 0.75), which is larger than the 5% probability of a dark room when drinking coffee.<|eot_id|>",
