Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. We know that taking medication causes high blood pressure. taking medication and high blood pressure causes healthy heart.

The direct relationship between medication and heart condition is that medication leads to a healthy heart, and the person is already taking medication, which means they already have a healthy heart. The chain of causality is: medication - high blood pressure (not a direct cause of heart condition) - healthy heart. If the person were not taking medication, they would not have high blood pressure, and without high blood pressure, they would not have a healthy heart. In that case, the person would likely experience heart problems.||",
