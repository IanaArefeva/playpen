Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 50%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 56%. For people who have a sister, would it be less likely to see healthy heart if the person did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is that higher blood pressure leads to a lower probability of a healthy heart. Since having a sister does not directly affect blood pressure, and the direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition is positive, it is not less likely to see a healthy heart if the person did not have a sister.<|eot_id|>",
