The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on having a brother and disease. Having a brother has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and do not have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 91%. For people with no pre-conditions and have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 84%. For people with pre-conditions and do not have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 21%. For people with pre-conditions and have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 16%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 44%. For people who have a brother, would it be less likely to see recovering from the disease if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
