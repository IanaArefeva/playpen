The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 7%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 39%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 66%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 99%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 58%. Will getting the vaccine increase the chance of being lactose intolerant?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of the vaccine on lactose intolerance is positive, meaning that the vaccine increases the probability of being lactose intolerant. However, the pre-conditions have a direct effect on both the vaccine and the probability of being lactose intolerant. In particular, having pre-conditions makes it more likely that one will get the vaccine (since the vaccine is more likely to be prescribed to those with pre-conditions) and also more likely to be lactose intolerant (since the probability of being lactose intolerant is higher among those with pre-conditions). This means that the positive effect of the vaccine on the probability of being lactose intolerant is overwhelmed by the positive effect of the pre-conditions on the same probability. In other words, the increase in the probability of being lactose intolerant due to the vaccine is offset by the increase in the probability of being lactose intolerant due to the pre-conditions.<|eot_id|>",
