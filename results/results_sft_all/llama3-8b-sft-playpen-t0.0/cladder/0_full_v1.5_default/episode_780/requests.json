Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of high salary is 50%. For individuals who are male, the probability of high salary is 73%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see high salary if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of being male on occupation is not directly quantified, but we can conclude that being male must lead to a higher probability of having a higher occupation than being female, since the direct effect of being male on having a high salary is positive. If we condition on not being male, we are left with the same set of possible occupation and skill levels as before, but with a lower probability of having a high occupation and a lower probability of having a high salary. The direct effect of not being male on having a high occupation is 0, since the direct effect of being male on occupation is not quantified. The direct effect of not being male on having a high salary is 23% (50% - 27%). Since the direct effect of not being male on having a high occupation is 0 and the direct effect of not being male on having a high salary is 23%, it is not more likely to see a high salary if the individual had not been male.<|eot_id|>",
