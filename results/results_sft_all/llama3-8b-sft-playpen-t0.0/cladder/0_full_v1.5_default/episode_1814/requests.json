Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 4%. The probability of taking the stairs and penguin death is 76%. The probability of taking the elevator and penguin death is 1%. Is the chance of penguin death larger when observing taking the elevator?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
