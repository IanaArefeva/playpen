The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Respiratory issues has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Black hair has a direct effect on hospitalization status. For hospitalized individuals, the correlation between respiratory issues and black hair is -0.18. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does it mean that respiratory issues does not affect black hair?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
