The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. For people who are famous, the correlation between attractive appearance and talent is -0.20. If we look at people who are famous, does it mean that attractive appearance affects talent?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the relationship between appearance and talent is already accounted for by the direct effect of talent on fame and the direct effect of appearance on fame. The negative correlation among famous people likely arises from the fact that those with higher talent are more likely to achieve fame, and among them, those with lower talent are more likely to have higher attractive appearance (perhaps due to being more focused on physical appearance rather than artistic pursuit). This does not imply a direct causal relationship between appearance and talent.||",
