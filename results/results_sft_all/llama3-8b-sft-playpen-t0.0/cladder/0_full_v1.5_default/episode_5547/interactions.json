The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on full moon and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on full moon. Full moon has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of full moon is 57%. The probability of no full moon and increased price is 20%. The probability of full moon and increased price is 43%. Is the chance of increased price larger when observing full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of full moon is 57%, the probability of no full moon is 43%. The difference in probability between the two scenarios is 23% (43% - 20%). This difference is larger than the difference in probability between the two scenarios when we condition on full moon (43% - 43% = 0%) and when we condition on no full moon (20% - 0% = 20%). This suggests that the chance of an increased price is larger when we do not condition on full moon, and that the chance of an increased price is larger when we condition on full moon than when we condition on no full moon.||",
