The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. We know that having a sister causes the corporal shooting and the private not shooting. the corporal shooting and the private shooting causes the prisoner's death. Would the prisoner is alive if not having a sister instead of having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of the corporal shooting and the private not shooting is that the prisoner is dead. Since having a sister directly leads to the corporal shooting and the private not shooting, and this in turn directly leads to the prisoner's death, we can conclude that if the person did not have a sister, the corporal would not shoot and the private would shoot, which would lead to the prisoner's death.<|eot_id|>",
