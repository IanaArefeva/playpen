The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 64%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 33%. Will waking up late decrease the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of Alice's on-time arrival is 64% when she wakes up on time and 33% when she wakes up late, which means that the state of the road (traffic) still exerts a direct and separate effect on her arrival time. The wake-up time and the state of the road are distinct causal factors that do not directly interact with each other.<|eot_id|>",
