The candle has a direct effect on room. For people not blowing out candles, the probability of dark room is 87%. For people who blow out candles, the probability of dark room is 55%. Will blowing out the candle increase the chance of dark room?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The candle has a direct effect on room, and the probability of dark room is 55% for people who blow out candles, which means that the candle's action is also a cause of the room being dark. Since the man's action is the primary cause of the room being dark, and the probability of dark room is already high (87%) for people not blowing out candles, the additional action of the man (or the man and the candle) will not increase the chance of dark room.<|eot_id|>",
