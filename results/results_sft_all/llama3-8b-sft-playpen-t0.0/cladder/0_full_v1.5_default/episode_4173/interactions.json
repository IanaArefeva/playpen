The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 6%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 20%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 88%. The overall probability of male gender is 60%. Will having a brother decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

          "content": "No\nThe probability of having a brother is higher for male patients (88%) than for female patients (12%). Since the probability of male gender is 60%, this means that a larger fraction of the total patient pool is male and has a brother than is female and has a brother. The higher probability of male patients having a brother is associated with a higher probability of recovery (88% compared to 20% for female patients with a brother), which suggests that having a brother is not a barrier to recovery. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case: having a brother is associated with a higher probability of recovery, especially for male patients.||",
