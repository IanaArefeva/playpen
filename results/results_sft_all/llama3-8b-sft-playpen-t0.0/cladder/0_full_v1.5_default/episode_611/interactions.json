The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 74%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 19%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 81%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between college degree and high salary is not fully accounted for, and the unobserved confounders play a role in this relationship. The probability of high salary is higher for those with a college degree (81%) than for those without (19%), but this does not directly imply that high salary is more likely than low salary overall. The unobserved confounders could still be biasing the relationship between college degree and high salary, and their effect on both education level and salary needs to be considered.||",
