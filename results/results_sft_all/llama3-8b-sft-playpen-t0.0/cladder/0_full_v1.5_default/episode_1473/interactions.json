The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 90%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 25%. Will alarm set by husband increase the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because setting the alarm directly counteracts the wife's effect on the alarm, which is to ring it. The husband's action of setting the alarm directly affects the probability of the alarm ringing, but in a negative way.||",
