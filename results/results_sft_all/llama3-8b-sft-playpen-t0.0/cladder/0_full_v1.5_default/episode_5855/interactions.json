The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 89%. For people who have a sister, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between having a sister and tar deposit is that having a sister directly affects the probability of tar deposit, with a higher probability of tar deposit when having a sister. The direct relationship between tar deposit and lung cancer is that a higher probability of tar deposit directly affects the probability of lung cancer, with a higher probability of lung cancer when there is a higher probability of tar deposit. Since having a sister directly affects both the probability of lung cancer and the probability of tar deposit, and a higher probability of tar deposit directly affects the probability of lung cancer, it can be concluded that having a sister directly affects the probability of lung cancer through the intermediate variable of tar deposit.||",
