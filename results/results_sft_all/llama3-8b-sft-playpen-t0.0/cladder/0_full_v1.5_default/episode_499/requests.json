Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 45%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 4%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 4%.

Since 55% of the population is unattractive and 45% is attractive, the overall probability of having talent is the same as the probability of being unattractive (4% * 0.55 = 2.2% for unattractive and 4% * 0.45 = 1.8% for attractive), which is less than the probability of lacking talent (100% - 4% = 96%).<|eot_id|>",
