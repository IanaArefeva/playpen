Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. We know that encouragement causes lack of studying. encouragement or studying hard causes high exam score.

In the absence of encouragement, the direct positive effect on exam score is lost, but the negative effect of encouragement on exam habits remains. If we consider the opposite condition - discouragement instead of encouragement - we would still have the direct positive effect of studying habits on exam score, which would likely lead to a higher exam score than if encouragement were present.<|eot_id|>",
