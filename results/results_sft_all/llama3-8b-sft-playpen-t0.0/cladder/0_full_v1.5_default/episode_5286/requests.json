The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 5%. For individuals who do not like spicy food, the probability of high salary is 53%. For individuals who like spicy food, the probability of high salary is 35%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high salary is higher for those who do not like spicy food (53%) than for those who like it (35%). This suggests that the positive effect of skill on occupation and salary is likely to be more significant than the positive effect of liking spicy food on occupation and subsequent salary.<|eot_id|>",
