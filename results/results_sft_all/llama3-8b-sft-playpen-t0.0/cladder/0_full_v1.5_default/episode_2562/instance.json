Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 94%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 52%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 32%. Is high infant mortality more likely than low infant mortality overall?",
