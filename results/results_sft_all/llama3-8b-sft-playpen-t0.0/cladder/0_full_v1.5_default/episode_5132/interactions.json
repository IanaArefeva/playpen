The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how education level correlates with foot size case by case according to unobserved confounders. Method 2: We look directly at how education level correlates with foot size in general. To understand how education level affects foot size, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between education level and foot size is the most reliable measure of their causal connection, as it controls for the unobserved confounders that might otherwise bias the result. Method 1 involves looking at the relationship on a case-by-case basis, which could still be subject to the influence of unobserved confounders. In this scenario, focusing on the general relationship between education level and foot size (Method 2) provides a more objective measure of their causal connection.||",
