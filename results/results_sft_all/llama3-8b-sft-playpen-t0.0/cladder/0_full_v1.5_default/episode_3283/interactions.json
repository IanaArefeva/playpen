The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 22%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 60%. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 39%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 76%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 23%. Will having visited England decrease the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
