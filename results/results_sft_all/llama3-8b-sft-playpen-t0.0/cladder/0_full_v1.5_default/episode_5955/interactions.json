The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes not having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to fire the employee. Would the employee is fired if not having visited England instead of having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that the CEO's decision to fire the employee directly affects the director and the employee, and that having visited England also directly affects the employee, we can conclude that the two separate direct effects cancel each other out in this specific scenario. If the CEO's decision to fire the employee directly affects the director and the employee, and having visited England also directly affects the employee, then the absence of having visited England (not having visited England) would not change the outcome of the employee being fired, as the direct effect of the CEO's decision on the director and the employee would still be present.||",
