The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. For campers who do not light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 81%. For campers who light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 64%. For campers who light a match, would it be less likely to see the forest on fire if the camper had not lit a match?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the action of lighting a match actually reduces the probability of the forest on fire, compared to not lighting a match. If the camper had not lit a match, the probability of the forest on fire would be higher (81% vs. 64%).<|eot_id|>",
