The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 37%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 45%. Does education level positively affect salary through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key point here is that the probability of a high salary is higher for those with a college degree or higher than for those without one, but this does not imply that the positive effect of education on salary is entirely through skill. The higher probability of a high salary among those with a college degree or higher could be due to additional unexplored direct relationships between education and salary, or it could be a result of skill being a mediating variable that itself has a direct relationship with salary. In either case, we cannot conclude that the positive effect of education on salary is entirely through skill.||",
