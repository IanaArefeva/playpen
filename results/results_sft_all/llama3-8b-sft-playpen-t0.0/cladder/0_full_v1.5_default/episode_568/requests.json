Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 37%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 45%. Does education level positively affect salary through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key point here is that the probability of a high salary is higher for those with a college degree or higher than for those without one, but this does not imply that the positive effect of education on salary is entirely through skill. The higher probability of a high salary among those with a college degree or higher could be due to additional unexplored direct relationships between education and salary, or it could be a result of skill being a mediating variable that itself has a direct relationship with salary. In either case, we cannot conclude that the positive effect of education on salary is entirely through skill.<|eot_id|>",
