The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. We know that having a sister causes the corporal shooting and the private shooting. the corporal shooting or the private shooting causes the prisoner's death. Would the prisoner is alive if not having a sister instead of having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the corporal and the private both have direct effects on the prisoner, and both the corporal and the private are caused by having a sister, we can conclude that having a sister is a necessary condition for the prisoner's death. If we remove the condition of having a sister, both the corporal and the private will not shoot, and as a result, the prisoner will not be killed.<|eot_id|>",
