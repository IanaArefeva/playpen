The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. We know that having a sister causes the corporal shooting and the private shooting. the corporal shooting or the private shooting causes the prisoner's death. Would the prisoner is alive if not having a sister instead of having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the corporal and the private both have direct effects on the prisoner, and both the corporal and the private are caused by having a sister, we can conclude that having a sister is a necessary condition for the prisoner's death. If we remove the condition of having a sister, both the corporal and the private will not shoot, and as a result, the prisoner will not be killed.||",
