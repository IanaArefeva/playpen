The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 7%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 37%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 65%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 96%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 41%. Will getting the vaccine decrease the chance of recovering from the disease?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the absence of pre-conditions, the vaccine still has a positive effect on the probability of recovery (37% vs. 7%). In the presence of pre-conditions, the vaccine further increases the probability of recovery (96% vs. 65%). This shows that the vaccine consistently improves the chance of recovery across both groups. The overall probability of pre-conditions being 41% does not change the individual effects of the vaccine on the probability of recovery.||",
