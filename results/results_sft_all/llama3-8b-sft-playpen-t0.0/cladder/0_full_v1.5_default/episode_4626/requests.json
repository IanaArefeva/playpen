The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 16%. The probability of not drinking coffee and dark room is 74%. The probability of drinking coffee and dark room is 9%. Is the chance of dark room smaller when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The difference in probability is 65% (74% - 9%). This indicates that the chance of a dark room is larger when observing drinking coffee, not smaller.<|eot_id|>",
