The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of speaking english is 6%. The probability of not speaking english and long lifespan is 76%. The probability of speaking english and long lifespan is 3%. Is the chance of long lifespan smaller when observing speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The only direct relationship we have is that diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan, and both speaking English and smoking have direct effects on diabetes. Since the probability of not speaking English and long lifespan is 76%, and the probability of speaking English and long lifespan is 3%, we can conclude that the chance of long lifespan is not smaller when observing speaking English.<|eot_id|>",
