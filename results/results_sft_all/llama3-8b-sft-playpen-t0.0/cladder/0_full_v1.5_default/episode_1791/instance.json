Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are sad, the probability of penguin death is 96%.

For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are sad, the probability of penguin death is 49%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are happy, the probability of penguin death is 26%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin happiness is 66%.
