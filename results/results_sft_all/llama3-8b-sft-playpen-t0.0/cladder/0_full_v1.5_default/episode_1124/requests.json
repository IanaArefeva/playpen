Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 37%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 63%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 22%.

Since this is not a valid probability (it's above 100%), we need to correct the calculation. The correct probability of non-recovery is 37% (not receiving treatment) + 78% (receiving treatment and not recovering) = 115%. To correct this, we need to find the correct probability of not recovering after treatment. The correct probability of not recovering after treatment is 78% (receiving treatment and not recovering) = 78%. The correct probability of non-recovery is 37% (not receiving treatment) + 78% (receiving treatment and not recovering) = 115%. To correct this, we need to find the correct probability of not recovering after treatment. The correct probability of not recovering after treatment is 78% (receiving treatment and not recovering) = 78%. The correct probability of non-recovery is 37% (not receiving treatment) + 78% (receiving treatment and not recovering) = 115%. To correct this, we need to find the correct probability of not recovering after treatment.
