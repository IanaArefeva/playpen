The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 7%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 78%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 45%. Is dark room less likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of dark room is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is (0.07 * 0.07) + (0.93 * 0.78) = 0.0739. The probability of bright room is 1 - 0.0739 = 0.9261. Since 0.9261 is greater than 0.0739, dark room is less likely than bright room overall.<|eot_id|>",
