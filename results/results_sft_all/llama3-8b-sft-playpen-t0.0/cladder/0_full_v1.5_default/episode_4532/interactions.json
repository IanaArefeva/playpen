The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and brown eyes. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on brown eyes. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of brown eyes is 59%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of brown eyes is 69%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 70%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 41%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of brown eyes?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is a direct effect, not an indirect one through the cigarette tax. The cigarette tax affects the probability of brown eyes by changing the probability of a mother smoking, which in turn affects the probability of having brown eyes. If we control for the cigarette tax, we can see that the direct relationship between maternal smoking and brown eyes is still positive, but the overall probability of brown eyes is lower in areas with higher cigarette tax. This is because the higher cigarette tax leads to a lower probability of a mother smoking, which in turn leads to a lower probability of having brown eyes.||",
