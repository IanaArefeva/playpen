The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 11%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 55%. Will the captain's order to execute the prisoner increase the chance of the prisoner's death?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The corporal's direct effect on the prisoner and the private's direct effect on the prisoner imply that the captain's order to execute the prisoner will lead to the corporal's action of putting the prisoner in the cell, and the private's action of not intervening, which in turn will lead to the prisoner's death. The probability of the prisoner's death is 55% when the captain executes the prisoner, which is higher than the 11% probability when the captain releases the prisoner.||",
