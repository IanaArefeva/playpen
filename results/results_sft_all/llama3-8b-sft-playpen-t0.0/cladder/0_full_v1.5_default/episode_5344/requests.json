The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 84%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of broken bones is 82%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of broken bones is 82%. Is broken bones less likely than no broken bones overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the overall probability of coffee consumption is 84%, the majority of the population will have broken bones. This means that the overall probability of broken bones is higher than the probability of no broken bones.<|eot_id|>",
