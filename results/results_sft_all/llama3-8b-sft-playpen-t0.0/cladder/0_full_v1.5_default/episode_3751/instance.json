Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 18%. For students who do not listen to jazz and rejected from elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 6%. For students who do not listen to jazz and accepted to elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 18%. For students who listen to jazz and rejected from elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 4%. For students who listen to jazz and accepted to elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 14%. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does the chance of being hard-working increase when listening to jazz?",
