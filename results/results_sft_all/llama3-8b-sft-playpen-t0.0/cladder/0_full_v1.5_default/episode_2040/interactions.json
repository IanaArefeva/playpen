The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between talent and being hard-working is -0.14. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does it mean that talent affects being hard-working?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between these two variables is likely spurious, as both are directly influenced by the same cause: being accepted to an elite institution. The negative correlation might stem from the fact that students who are more talented might feel less need to work hard to achieve their goals, while those who are less talented might feel more pressure to work harder to compensate for their lack of natural ability. This interpretation is supported by the direct effects of both talent and effort on elite institution admission status, which indicate that both variables are separate causes of this outcome.||",
