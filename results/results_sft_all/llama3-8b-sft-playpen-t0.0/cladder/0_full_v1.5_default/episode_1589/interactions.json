The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of the captain's order to execute the prisoner is 18%. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 33%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 81%. Is the prisoner's death more likely than the prisoner being alive overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 82% of the time, the captain will not order the execution, and the probability of the prisoner's death in this case is 0%. For the 18% of the time when the captain does order the execution, the probability of the prisoner's death is 81%. To find the overall probability of the prisoner's death, we need to consider both scenarios: the 82% of the time when the captain does not order the execution (with a 0% chance of death) and the 18% of the time when the captain does order the execution (with an 81% chance of death). The overall probability of the prisoner's death is then (0.82 * 0) + (0.18 * 0.81) = 0.01458, which is less than 0.5, meaning the probability of the prisoner being alive is higher than the probability of the prisoner's death.||",
