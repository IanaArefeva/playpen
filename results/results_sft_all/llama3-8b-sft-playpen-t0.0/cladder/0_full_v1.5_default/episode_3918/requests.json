The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 14%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 55%. For individuals who have visited England, would it be more likely to see high salary if the individual had not visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we are focusing on the subpopulation that has already visited England, we can condition on this event and examine the relationship between skill and salary. In this subpopulation, the probability of high salary is 55%. If we further condition on the event that the individual has not visited England, we are still within the subpopulation that has already visited England, and the probability of high salary remains 55%. This is because the direct effect of having not visited England on occupation and salary is already accounted for in the base probability of 55% for this subpopulation.<|eot_id|>",
