The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 48%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 72%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 16%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 37%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 52%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 26%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 78%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 57%. The overall probability of good health is 1%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would having a sister positively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The table only provides the probability of high infant mortality for different subgroups of infants, which does not directly imply a positive or negative effect of having a sister on infant's birth weight. The table does show that having a sister is associated with lower probability of high infant mortality in the subgroups with normal birth weight (16% for those with a sister and normal birth weight, compared to 72% for those without a sister and normal birth weight), which might imply a positive effect of having a sister on infant's birth weight.<|eot_id|>",
