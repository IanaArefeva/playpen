The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes vitamin C deficiency, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes scurvy. Would the patient has scurvy if absence of citrus instead of citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the absence of citrus, the patient would likely have lower levels of vitamin C. Since we already know that citrus consumption leads to a reduction in vitamin C, it's reasonable to conclude that the absence of citrus would lead to higher levels of vitamin C. With higher levels of vitamin C, the patient would be less likely to contract scurvy.||",
