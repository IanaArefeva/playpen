The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 58%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 60%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of liking spicy food is 56%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of liking spicy food is 45%. Will liking spicy food decrease the chance of cholera contraction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of cholera contraction is higher in the group that likes spicy food more (60% for the global water company vs. 58% for the local water company), which further supports this positive relationship.<|eot_id|>",
