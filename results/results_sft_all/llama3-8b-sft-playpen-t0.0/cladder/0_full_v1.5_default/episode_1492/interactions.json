The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 20%. The probability of not blowing out the candle and dark room is 79%. The probability of blowing out the candle and dark room is 11%. Is the chance of dark room smaller when observing blowing out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of the candle being blown out is 20%, the overall probability of a dark room is a weighted average of the two scenarios, which is (0.2 * 0.11) + (0.8 * 0.79) = 0.16. This is less than the probability of a dark room when the candle is not blown out (0.79), so the chance of a dark room is not smaller when observing the candle being blown out.||",
