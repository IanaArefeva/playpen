The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 85%. For days when Alice wakes up late, would it be less likely to see arriving to school on time if Alice had gotten up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that, in the case where she wakes up late, she is more likely to arrive on time than in the case where she wakes up on time. If she were to get up on time, she would still have a lower probability of arriving on time compared to the case where she wakes up late.<|eot_id|>",
