The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of speaking english is 8%. The probability of not speaking english and long lifespan is 63%. The probability of speaking english and long lifespan is 3%. Is the chance of long lifespan larger when observing speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only direct relationship we have is that diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan, and both speaking English and smoking have direct effects on diabetes. Since the probability of not speaking English and long lifespan is 63%, which is higher than the probability of speaking English and long lifespan (3%), it suggests that not speaking English might be associated with a higher chance of long lifespan.||",
