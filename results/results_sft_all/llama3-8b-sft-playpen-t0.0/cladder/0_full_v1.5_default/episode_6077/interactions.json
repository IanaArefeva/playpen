The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drinking coffee and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active and close to a college causes drinking coffee. confounder active and drinking coffee causes high salary. We observed the person lives close to a college and confounder inactive. Would the employee has a low salary if drinking coffee instead of not drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the person is close to a college and their confounder is active, they will drink coffee. The direct effect of coffee on their salary is positive, meaning that if they drink coffee, their salary will be higher than if they don't. Since the person's unobserved confounder is active, their salary will be higher than if the confounder was inactive. In this case, the person's unobserved confounder is active, so their salary will be higher than if the confounder was inactive, and the direct effect of coffee on their salary is positive, so their salary will be higher than if they didn't drink coffee.||",
