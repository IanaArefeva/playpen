The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and peanut allergy. Treatment has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of receives treatment is 49%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 32%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 71%. Is being allergic to peanuts more likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of not receiving treatment is 51% (100% - 49%), we can calculate the overall probability of being allergic to peanuts as follows: (0.32 * 0.51) + (0.71 * 0.49) = 0.1632 + 0.3481 = 0.5113. This is less than 0.5, so being allergic to peanuts is less likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall.||",
