Skill has a direct effect on salary. We know that college degree or higher causes high skill level, and we know that high skill level causes high salary.

The intervening variable of skill level must be considered. If the person has a college degree or higher, it directly affects their skill level, which in turn affects their salary. If the person has a high school degree or lower, it also directly affects their skill level, which in turn affects their salary. The key point is that the direct relationship between college degree or higher and high skill level, and between high skill level and high salary, does not imply that college degree or higher directly leads to a high salary. The correct chain of causality is: college degree or higher -> high skill level -> high salary.<|eot_id|>",
