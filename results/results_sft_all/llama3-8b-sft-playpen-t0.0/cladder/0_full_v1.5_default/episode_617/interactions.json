The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 59%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 25%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 59%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the relationship between education level and salary is not entirely causal, as the unobserved confounders are also influencing the outcome (salary). Since the unobserved confounders are unobserved, we cannot directly account for their effects. The given probabilities for high and college degree or higher are also not directly useful in this context, as they do not control for the unobserved confounders. The direct relationship between college degree and high salary is also not fully causal, as the unobserved confounders are still at play. In light of this, we must conclude that the relationship between college degree and high salary is not fully causal, and that the unobserved confounders are likely to be a major factor in determining the overall likelihood of high salary.||",
