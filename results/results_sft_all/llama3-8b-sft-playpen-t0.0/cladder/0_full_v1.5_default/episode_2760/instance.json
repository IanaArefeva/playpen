Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 23%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 46%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 32%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 67%. Will smoking mother decrease the chance of normal infant birth weight?",
