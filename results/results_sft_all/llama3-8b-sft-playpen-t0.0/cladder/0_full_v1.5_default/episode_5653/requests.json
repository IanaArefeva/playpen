The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 98%. For patients who have small kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 85%. For patients who have large kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 23%. For patients who have large kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 9%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 57%. For patients who speak english, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The ability to speak English also has a direct effect on recovery, and this effect is not uniform across all groups. In particular, for patients with small kidney stones, the probability of recovery is higher when they speak English (85%) than when they do not (98%). This suggests that the ability to speak English may actually increase the probability of recovery for patients with small kidney stones, rather than decreasing it.\nTo further support this argument, consider the following: if the ability to speak English were to reduce the probability of recovery for patients with small kidney stones, we would expect the probability of recovery for this group to be lower when they speak English than when they do not. Since this is not the case (85% vs. 98%), we can conclude that the ability to speak English does not reduce the probability of recovery for patients with small kidney stones.\nGiven that the direct effect of kidney stone size on recovery is not the only factor at play, and that the ability to speak English may actually increase the probability of recovery for patients with small kidney stones, we can conclude that it would not be less likely to see recovery if the patient did not speak English.<|eot_id|>",
