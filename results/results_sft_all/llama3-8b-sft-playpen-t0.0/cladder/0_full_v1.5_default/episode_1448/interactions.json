The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 13%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 72%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 24%. Is ringing alarm less likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a ring alarm when the husband sets the alarm is 0.24, and the probability of a ring alarm when the husband doesn't set the alarm is 0.72. The probability of the husband setting the alarm is 0.13, and the probability of the husband not setting the alarm is 0.87. The overall probability of a ring alarm is then 0.24 * 0.13 + 0.72 * 0.87, which is 0.26. The probability of a silent alarm is the probability of the husband setting the alarm (0.13) times the probability of a ring alarm when the husband sets the alarm (0.24), which is 0.0312. The probability of a ring alarm (0.26) is higher than the probability of a silent alarm (0.0312), so the ring alarm is more likely than the silent alarm.||",
