Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 4%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 35%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 63%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 93%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 55%. For people getting the vaccine, would it be more likely to see recovering from the disease if the person had not refused the vaccine?",
