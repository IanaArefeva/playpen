The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how education level correlates with salary in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to unobserved confounders. To understand how education level affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If we look at the general correlation between education level and salary (Method 1), we will likely overestimate the effect of education on salary, as the unobserved confounders will also be associated with higher education and higher salary. In contrast, looking at the relationship case by case according to unobserved confounders (Method 2) will help control for the confounding effect and provide a more accurate estimate of the direct effect of education on salary.||",
