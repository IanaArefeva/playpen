The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 96%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 68%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of smoking is 96%, this means that the vast majority of the population is at risk for lung cancer. The direct relationship between smoke and lung cancer further solidifies this risk. In this context, it is more likely than not that an individual will have lung cancer, rather than not have it.||",
