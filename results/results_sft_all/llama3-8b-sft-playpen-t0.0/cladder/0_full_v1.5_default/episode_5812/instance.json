For people who have a brother and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 82%. For people who have a brother and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 59%. For people who do not have a brother and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 84%. For people who do not have a brother and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 52%. For people who have a brother and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 59%. For people who have a brother and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 28%. The overall probability of high pollution is 41%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would having a brother positively affect lung cancer?",
