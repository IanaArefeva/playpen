The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 76%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 47%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 76%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 45%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 76%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 27%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 61%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 36%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 96%. Does gender positively affect admission status through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key insight here is that the direct effect of being male on admission status is not positive; in fact, being male is associated with a lower probability of admission acceptance (45% vs. 47% for non-male individuals in competitive departments). The positive relationship between being male and admission status is only through the intermediate variable of department competitiveness, which is not a direct cause of admission status.||",
