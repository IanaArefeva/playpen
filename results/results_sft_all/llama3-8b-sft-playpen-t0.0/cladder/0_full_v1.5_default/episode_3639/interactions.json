The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Lip thickness has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 43%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of thick lips is 10%. For people considered attractive, the probability of thick lips is 10%. Is thick lips more likely than thin lips overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of thick lips is the same for both unattractive and attractive people, which means that thick lips do not provide additional information about a person's likelihood of being famous beyond what is already accounted for by their appearance. Since the probability of thick lips is the same for both unattractive and attractive people, and the direct relationship between thick lips and fame is not as strong as the direct relationship between appearance and fame, we conclude that thick lips are not more likely than thin lips overall.||",
