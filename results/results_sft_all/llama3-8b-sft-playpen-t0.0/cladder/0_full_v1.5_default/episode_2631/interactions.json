The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 45%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 72%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 78%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of smoking is 45%, this means that 55% of the population is not smoking. For this 55%, the probability of lung cancer is 72%, which is lower than the 78% probability of lung cancer among smokers. This indicates that the overall probability of lung cancer is lower than the probability of absence of lung cancer.||",
