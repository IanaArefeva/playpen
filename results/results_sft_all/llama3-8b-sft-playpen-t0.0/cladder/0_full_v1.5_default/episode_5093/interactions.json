The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 88%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 12%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 26%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 26% of the total population (88% of the total) has a high salary. The remaining 12% of the total population (12% of the total) has a high salary, which is the probability of high salary for those who do not have a brother.
