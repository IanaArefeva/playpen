The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 7%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 13%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 67%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 21%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 67%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of being a smoker on the probability of lung cancer is still present, even when there is no tar deposit. In particular, for smokers with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 13%, which is higher than the 7% probability for nonsmokers with no tar deposit. This suggests that being a smoker still confers a higher risk of lung cancer, independent of the presence of tar deposit.<|eot_id|>",
