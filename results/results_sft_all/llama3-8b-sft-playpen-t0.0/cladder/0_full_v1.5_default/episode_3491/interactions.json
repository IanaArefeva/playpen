The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 4%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 7%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 60%. Is large feet less likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of large feet among those who use tanning salon treatments is 60%, which is higher than the 4% probability of tanning salon use. This suggests that tanning salon use is associated with larger foot size. The beach activities likely have a similar positive effect on foot size. Since both tanning salon use and beach activities are associated with larger foot size, and the probability of large feet is higher than the probability of tanning salon use, it is likely that large feet are more common than small feet in this world.||",
