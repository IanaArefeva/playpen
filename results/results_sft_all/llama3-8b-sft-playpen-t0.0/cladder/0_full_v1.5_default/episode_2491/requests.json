The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 48%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 25%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 75%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of not receiving treatment is 0.52 (1 - 0.48), the overall probability of non-recovery is 0.52 * 0.75 + 0.48 * 0.25 = 0.39. The probability of recovery is 1 - 0.39 = 0.61. Since 0.61 is less than 0.75, the probability of non-recovery is higher than the probability of recovery overall.<|eot_id|>",
