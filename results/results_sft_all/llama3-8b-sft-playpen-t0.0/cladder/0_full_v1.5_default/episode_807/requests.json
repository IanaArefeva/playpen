Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of respiratory issues is 59%. For people with no respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 5%. For people with respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 5%. Is broken bones more likely than no broken bones overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of respiratory issues is 59%, the number of people with respiratory issues is likely to be higher than the number of people without. This means that the number of people with broken bones (5% of the total) is likely to be higher in the group with respiratory issues than in the group without. Since the probability of broken bones is the same for both groups, the overall probability of broken bones will be lower than the probability of no broken bones.<|eot_id|>",
