The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 66%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 89%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 43%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 58%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 44%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 78%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 4%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 55%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 4%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender negatively affect admission status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
