The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 34%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 73%. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 44%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 83%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 11%. Will having visited England increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the probability of the CEO having made a decision to fire the employee is not directly related to the probability of the CEO having also made a separate decision to visit England. The direct relationship between the CEO's decision to fire the employee and the probability of the employee being fired is more closely associated with the CEO's decision to fire the employee rather than the separate decision to visit England.||",
