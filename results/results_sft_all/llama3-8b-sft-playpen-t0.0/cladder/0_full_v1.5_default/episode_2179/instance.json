For individuals who are male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 62%. For individuals who are male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 41%. For individuals who are not male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 49%. For individuals who are not male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 22%. For individuals who are male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 77%. For individuals who are male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 49%. The overall probability of high skill level is 92%.
