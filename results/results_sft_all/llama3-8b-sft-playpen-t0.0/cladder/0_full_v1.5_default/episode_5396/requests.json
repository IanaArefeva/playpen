The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 14%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 52%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 35%. Is being lactose intolerant more likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of intelligent parents is 14%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction: (0.14 * 0.35) + (0.86 * 0.52) = 0.049 + 0.4484 = 0.4974. This is less than 0.5, so being lactose intolerant is less likely than not being lactose intolerant overall.<|eot_id|>",
