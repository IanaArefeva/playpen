The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 52%. The probability of high school degree or lower and high salary is 33%. The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 20%. Is the chance of high salary larger when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 20%, which is lower than the probability of college degree or higher (52%) and the probability of high school degree or lower and high salary (33%). This suggests that the positive relationship between college degree or higher and high salary is offset by the negative relationship between unobserved confounders and both college degree or higher and high salary.||",
