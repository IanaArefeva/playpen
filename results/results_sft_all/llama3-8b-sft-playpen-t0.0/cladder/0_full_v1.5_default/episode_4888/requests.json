The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on black hair. Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 93%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of black hair is 70%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of black hair is 28%. Is black hair more likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of going to the beach on black hair is also a reduction in the probability of black hair. Since the probability of tanning salon treatment is 93%, most people will have a lower probability of black hair. The beach has a direct effect on black hair, but its overall probability is lower than that of tanning salon treatment. The beach's direct effect on black hair is not strong enough to counteract the reduction in black hair probability caused by tanning salon treatment.<|eot_id|>",
