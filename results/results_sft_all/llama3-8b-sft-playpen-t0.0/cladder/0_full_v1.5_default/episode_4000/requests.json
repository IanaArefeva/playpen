The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how liking spicy food correlates with child's intelligence in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to parents' social status. To understand how liking spicy food affects child's intelligence, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the relationship between liking spicy food and child's intelligence is not direct, but rather indirect through the parents' social status. In this case, looking at the correlation case by case according to parents' social status (Method 2) is more appropriate than looking at the general correlation between liking spicy food and child's intelligence (Method 1), as it controls for the intermediate variable and provides a more accurate picture of the relationship between the variables of interest.<|eot_id|>",
