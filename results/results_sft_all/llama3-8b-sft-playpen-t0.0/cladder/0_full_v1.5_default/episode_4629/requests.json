The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 17%. The probability of not drinking coffee and dark room is 77%. The probability of drinking coffee and dark room is 11%. Is the chance of dark room larger when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since 77% is larger than 11%, the chance of a dark room is larger when not observing (or in this case, not drinking) coffee.<|eot_id|>",
