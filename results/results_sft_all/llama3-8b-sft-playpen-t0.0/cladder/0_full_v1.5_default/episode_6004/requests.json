Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that solar eclipse or heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is no traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if solar eclipse instead of no solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we are now supposing a solar eclipse instead of no solar eclipse, we must consider the chain of effects: solar eclipse → no solar eclipse (since the two are opposite) → Alice's arrival on time. In this chain, the solar eclipse directly counteracts the condition that typically leads to Alice's on-time arrival. This counteraction would likely lead to a different outcome than the one we typically observe under the condition of no solar eclipse.<|eot_id|>",
