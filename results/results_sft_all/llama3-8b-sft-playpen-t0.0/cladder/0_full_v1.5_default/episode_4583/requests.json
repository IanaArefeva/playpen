The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 15%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 82%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 24%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that only 3.6% of the population (15% of 24%) will ring their alarm. In contrast, for those who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 82%, and since 85% of the population does not have a brother, this still means that 71.4% of the population will ring their alarm. Since 71.4% is greater than 3.6%, the overall probability of ringing alarm is higher than the probability of a silent alarm.<|eot_id|>",
