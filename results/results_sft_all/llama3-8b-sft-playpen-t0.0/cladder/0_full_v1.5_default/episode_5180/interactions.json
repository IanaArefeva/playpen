The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 76%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 35%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 49%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 4%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 62%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 2%. Does encouragement level positively affect brown eyes through studying habit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
