The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 76%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 35%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 49%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 4%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 62%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 2%. Does encouragement level positively affect brown eyes through studying habit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between encouragement and brown eyes is not established in the given conditions. The probability of brown eyes is higher for students who are not encouraged than for those who are encouraged, which might imply a negative relationship between encouragement and brown eyes.<|eot_id|>",
