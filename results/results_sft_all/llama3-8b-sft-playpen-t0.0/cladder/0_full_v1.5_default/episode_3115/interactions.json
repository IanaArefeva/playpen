The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. We know that smoking causes high tar deposit, and we know that high tar deposit causes absence of lung cancer. Would the person has lung cancer if nonsmoking instead of smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The correct chain of causality is: Smoking - high tar deposit - absence of lung cancer. If the person were a nonsmoker, the chain of causality would be: Nonsmoking - lower tar deposit (or no tar deposit) - lung cancer. This separate chain of causality shows that the person could still have lung cancer if they were a nonsmoker, as the absence of lung cancer is not a direct result of not smoking.||",
