Since we already know that the applicant is out of state, we can conclude that the in-state residency condition is not met. The male gender condition is still present, and we have established that male gender causes a competitive department. This separate condition of male gender being present still holds, and we have no reason to conclude that the male gender condition would cancel out the effects of the in-state condition. In fact, we have a separate condition that male gender and in-state residency cause admission acceptance, which still holds in this case since male gender is present. The direct effect of male gender on competitive department is separate from the direct effect of in-state residency on competitive department, and since male gender is present, we can conclude that the applicant will still get admission acceptance.<|eot_id|>",
