The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 11%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 27%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 93%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 52%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both education level and salary, which means that the positive association between college degree or higher and high salary could be spurious. The distance to the college also has a direct effect on both education level and salary, which further complicates the relationship. The observed differences in the probability of college degree or higher and high salary between people living far and close to a college are likely due to the differences in the unobserved confounders and the distance to the college rather than a direct effect of college degree or higher on high salary.||",
