The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how liking spicy food correlates with salary in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to occupation. To understand how liking spicy food affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that occupation acts as a bridge between the unobserved skill and the observed salary. If we look at the correlation between liking spicy food and salary in general (Method 1), we are essentially looking at the joint effect of occupation and skill on salary, without accounting for the direct relationship between occupation and skill. This can lead to confounding bias, as the observed relationship between liking spicy food and salary might be spurious and not directly causal. In contrast, looking at the correlation case by case according to occupation (Method 2) controls for the occupation variable, which acts as a bridge between the unobserved skill and the observed salary. This approach can help to isolate the direct effect of liking spicy food on salary, free from the confounding influence of occupation.<|eot_id|>",
