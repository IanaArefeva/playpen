Effort has a direct effect on freckles. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of freckles is 92%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of freckles is 50%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of freckles is 80%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of freckles is 36%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 17%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 74%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect freckles?",
