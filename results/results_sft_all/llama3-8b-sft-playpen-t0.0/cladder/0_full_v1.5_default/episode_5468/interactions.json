The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of playing card games is 91%. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 85%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 64%. Is long lifespan less likely than short lifespan overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of long lifespan is higher for card game players than for non-card game players, which further supports this positive relationship. The direct relationship between diabetes and lifespan also indicates that diabetes has a negative effect on long lifespan. Since the probability of long lifespan is higher for card game players than for non-card game players, and the probability of long lifespan is higher for people without diabetes than for those with diabetes, it can be concluded that long lifespan is more likely than short lifespan overall.||",
