The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 10%. The probability of nonsmoking and freckles is 48%. The probability of smoking and freckles is 5%. Is the chance of freckles smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of freckles is also directly related to the probability of not smoking, which is 90% (100% - 10% of those who smoke). Since the probability of freckles is 48%, and this is higher than the 5% probability of both smoking and freckles, it suggests that the relationship between not smoking and freckles is more significant than the relationship between smoking and freckles. This means that the chance of freckles is not smaller when observing smoking, but rather that the chance of freckles is more likely to be associated with not smoking than with smoking.||",
