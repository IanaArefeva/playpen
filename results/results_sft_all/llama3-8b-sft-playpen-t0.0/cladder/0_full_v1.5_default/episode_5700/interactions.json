The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 85%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 65%. For infants who have a sister, would it be more likely to see high infant mortality if the infant did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

          "content": "No\nThe direct relationship between having a sister and lower infant mortality (65% vs 85%) already controls for the potential confounding effect of health condition. Since the health condition is unobserved and its direct effect on both birth weight and infant mortality is not accounted for, we must consider the joint effect of having a sister and the unobserved health condition on infant mortality. If having a sister directly reduces the risk of high infant mortality, then the joint effect of having a sister and the unobserved health condition would still lead to a lower risk of high infant mortality compared to not having a sister. In this case, the additional information that the infant does not have a sister would not increase the likelihood of high infant mortality, as the direct positive effect of having a sister on infant mortality already counteracts the potential negative effect of the unobserved health condition.||",
