The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 85%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 65%. For infants who have a sister, would it be more likely to see high infant mortality if the infant did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the health condition is unobserved and its direct effect on both birth weight and infant mortality is not accounted for, we must consider the joint effect of having a sister and the unobserved health condition on infant mortality. If having a sister directly reduces the risk of high infant mortality, then the joint effect of having a sister and the unobserved health condition would still lead to a lower risk of high infant mortality compared to not having a sister. In this case, the additional information that the infant does not have a sister would not increase the likelihood of high infant mortality, as the direct positive effect of having a sister on infant mortality already counteracts the potential negative effect of the unobserved health condition.<|eot_id|>",
