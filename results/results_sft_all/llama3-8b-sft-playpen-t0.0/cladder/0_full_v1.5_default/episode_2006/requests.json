The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 40%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 51%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 78%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 37%. Will college degree or higher decrease the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of college degree or higher on high salary is not quantified in the given information, and we must consider the joint effects of the unobserved confounders and the distance to the college. The probability of high salary is higher for those living close to a college (51%) than for those living far from a college (40%), which might imply that college degree or higher could lead to higher chances of high salary.<|eot_id|>",
