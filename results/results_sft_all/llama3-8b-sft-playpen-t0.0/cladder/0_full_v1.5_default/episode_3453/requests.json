Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For situations where there is no solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 74%. For situations where there is a solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 30%. Will solar eclipse increase the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the solar eclipse directly counteracts the positive effect of not having a solar eclipse, which is a 74% chance of arriving on time. In the absence of a solar eclipse, the probability of Alice arriving on time is 74%, and the solar eclipse directly reduces this probability to 30%. This reduction in probability directly affects Alice's arrival time, making it less likely for her to arrive on time when there is a solar eclipse.<|eot_id|>",
