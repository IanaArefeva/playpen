Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 48%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 36%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that being male directly decreases the likelihood of admission acceptance by 12 percentage points. If we consider the counterfactual scenario where the individual is not male, we would still be subject to the same 48% probability of admission acceptance, which is higher than the 36% probability associated with being male. This indicates that being male does not lead to a higher probability of admission acceptance compared to being not male.<|eot_id|>",
