The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how gender correlates with salary case by case according to occupation. Method 2: We look directly at how gender correlates with salary in general. To understand how gender affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since skill is unobserved, we must account for its effect through occupation. In this case, looking at the direct relationship between gender and salary (Method 2) would not control for the mediating effect of occupation, which is directly related to both skill and salary. In contrast, looking at how gender correlates with salary case by case according to occupation (Method 1) would account for the mediating role of occupation, providing a more accurate picture of the relationship between gender and salary.||",
