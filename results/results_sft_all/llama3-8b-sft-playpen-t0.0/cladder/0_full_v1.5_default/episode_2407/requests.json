The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 55%. The probability of receives no treatment and recovery is 14%. The probability of receives treatment and recovery is 41%. Is the chance of recovery smaller when observing receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a male individual being treated is 55%, and the probability of a male individual being both treated and recovered is 41%. In this context, the chance of recovery is not smaller when observing an individual who has been treated; rather, it is higher.<|eot_id|>",
