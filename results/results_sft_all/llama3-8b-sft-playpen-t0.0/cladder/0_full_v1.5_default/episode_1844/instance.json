Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of vaccination is 7%. The probability of lack of vaccination and smallpox survival is 52%. The probability of vaccination and smallpox survival is 4%. Is the chance of smallpox survival smaller when observing vaccination?",
