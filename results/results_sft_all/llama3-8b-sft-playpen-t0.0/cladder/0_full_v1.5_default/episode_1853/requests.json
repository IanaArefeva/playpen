The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Vaccination status has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 27%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 37%. Will vaccination decrease the chance of smallpox survival?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between vaccination reaction and smallpox survival is also positive, as a positive vaccination reaction likely indicates a higher chance of smallpox survival. The direct relationship between smallpox and smallpox survival is positive, as the occurrence of smallpox directly affects the probability of smallpox survival. The direct relationship between vaccination and smallpox is also positive, as vaccination directly affects the probability of smallpox occurrence.<|eot_id|>",
