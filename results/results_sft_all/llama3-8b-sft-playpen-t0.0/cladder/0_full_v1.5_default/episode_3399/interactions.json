The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 31%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 46%. For situations where there is a full moon, would it be more likely to see wet ground if there were a full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This directly answers the question, which is whether it is more likely to see wet ground if there were a full moon. The higher probability of wet ground under a full moon indicates that the full moon has a positive effect on the likelihood of seeing wet ground.||",
