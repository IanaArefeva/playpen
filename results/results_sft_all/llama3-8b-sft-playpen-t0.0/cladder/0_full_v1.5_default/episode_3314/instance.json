The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 29%. For people who have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 50%. For people who have a sister, would it be more likely to see the prisoner's death if the person did not have a sister?",
