The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 61%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 32%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of high infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high infant mortality is lower for infants with smoking mothers (32%) compared to those with nonsmoking mothers (61%). This suggests that the positive effect of not smoking on birth weight might counteract the negative direct effect of smoking on birth weight, leading to a lower probability of high infant mortality for those with smoking mothers.<|eot_id|>",
