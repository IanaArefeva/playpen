Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 5%. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 78%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 46%.

The direct relationship between effort and college admission is that higher effort leads to higher college admission. The overall probability of college admission is a function of both the probability of not smoking (95%) and the probability of college admission for those who do not smoke (78%), which is higher than the probability of college admission for those who smoke (46%). Since the probability of college admission is higher than the probability of college rejection for those who do not smoke, and the probability of not smoking is higher than the probability of smoking, the overall probability of college admission is higher than the probability of college rejection.<|eot_id|>",
