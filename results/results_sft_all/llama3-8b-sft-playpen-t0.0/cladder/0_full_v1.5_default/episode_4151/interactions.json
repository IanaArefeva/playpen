The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and rainfall. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 42%. The probability of reduced supply and high rainfall is 42%. The probability of increased supply and high rainfall is 22%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing increased supply?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between demand and supply means that demand exerts a direct causal influence on supply. The direct relationship between demand and supply also means that demand exerts an indirect causal influence on rainfall through its direct effect on supply. The direct relationship between yield per acre and supply means that yield per acre exerts a direct causal influence on supply. The direct relationship between supply and rainfall means that supply exerts a direct causal influence on rainfall. The direct relationship between demand and supply, and the direct relationship between yield per acre and supply, imply that demand and yield per acre both exerts an indirect causal influence on rainfall through their direct effects on supply. The direct relationship between demand and supply, and the direct relationship between yield per acre and supply, also imply that demand and yield per acre both exerts an indirect causal influence on demand through their direct effects on supply. The direct relationship between demand and supply, and the direct relationship between yield per acre and supply, further imply that demand and yield per acre both exerts an indirect causal influence on demand through their direct effects on demand. The direct relationship between demand and supply, and the direct relationship between yield per acre and supply, finally imply that demand and yield per acre both exerts an indirect causal influence on demand through their direct effects on demand.
