The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and lip thickness. Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 6%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 16%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 79%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 90%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 49%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of thick lips?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and the direct effect of treatment on lip thickness are both established. The table of probabilities provides a clear picture of the relationships between these variables. The probability of thick lips is higher for those with large kidney stones than for those with small kidney stones, both with and without treatment. This suggests that kidney stone size is the primary driver of the probability of thick lips. The probability of thick lips is higher for those with large kidney stones than for those with small kidney stones, both with and without treatment. This further solidifies the idea that kidney stone size is the primary driver of the probability of thick lips. The direct effect of kidney stone size on the probability of thick lips is not altered by the presence or absence of treatment.
