The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 84%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 28%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 5%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being a smoker is 84%, and the probability of being a nonsmoker is 16%. The probability of lung cancer among smokers is 5%, and the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers is 28%. The overall probability of lung cancer is then (0.84 * 0.05) + (0.16 * 0.28) = 0.0424 + 0.0448 = 0.0872. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.0872 = 0.9128. Since 0.9128 is greater than 0.0872, lung cancer is less likely than absence of lung cancer overall.<|eot_id|>",
