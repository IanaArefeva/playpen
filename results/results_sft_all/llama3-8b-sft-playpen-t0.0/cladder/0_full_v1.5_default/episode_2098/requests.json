Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 8%. The probability of non-male gender and admission acceptance is 47%. The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 3%. Is the chance of admission acceptance larger when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that male gender is associated with higher department competitiveness, which in turn is associated with higher admission acceptance. The given probabilities of male and non-male gender and their corresponding admission acceptance rates are: male: 3% (admission), 8% (total), and non-male: 47% (admission), 92% (total). The higher probability of admission acceptance among non-male gender (47%) compared to male gender (3%) suggests that the chance of admission acceptance is larger when observing non-male gender, not male.<|eot_id|>",
