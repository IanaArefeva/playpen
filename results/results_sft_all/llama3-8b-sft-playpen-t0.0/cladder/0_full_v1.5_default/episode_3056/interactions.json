Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives treatment. large kidney stone and receives treatment causes recovery. We observed the patient has a small kidney stone.

Since the patient has a small kidney stone, they would not typically require treatment. The direct relationship between treatment and recovery is that treatment leads to recovery. If the patient doesn't have a large kidney stone and doesn't require treatment, they would still not have a direct cause for not recovering. The chain of cause and effect is: large kidney stone size  treatment  recovery. Since the patient has a small kidney stone and doesn't require treatment, the chain is broken, and we can conclude that the patient would still recover, not that they won't.||",
