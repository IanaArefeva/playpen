The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 11%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 37%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 18%. Is admission acceptance more likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of male gender is 11%, this means that 89% of the population is not male. The 37% probability of admission acceptance for non-male individuals is higher than the 18% probability for male individuals, which further suggests that lower male representation in the department is associated with higher admission acceptance. This chain of relationships—male gender associated with lower department competitiveness, which in turn is associated with higher admission acceptance—implies that male representation in the department is lower than the 11% probability of male gender in the general population. This, in turn, means that the overall probability of admission acceptance is lower than the 37% probability for non-male individuals, which is the larger fraction of the population.||",
