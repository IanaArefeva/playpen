The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and curly hair. Penguin mood has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 4%. The probability of taking the stairs and curly hair is 76%. The probability of taking the elevator and curly hair is 1%. Is the chance of curly hair larger when observing taking the elevator?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
