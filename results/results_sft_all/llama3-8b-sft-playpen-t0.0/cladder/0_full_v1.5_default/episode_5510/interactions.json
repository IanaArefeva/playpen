The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 16%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 49%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 38%. Is curly hair more likely than straight hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that only a fraction of the total population (16%) has a higher chance of having curly hair. The remaining 84% of the population, who do not consume citrus, have a 49% chance of having curly hair. Since 49% is higher than 38%, the overall probability of having curly hair is still higher than that of having straight hair, which is 0% for those who consume citrus and 51% for those who do not.||",
