The candle has a direct effect on room. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 84%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 50%. For people who drink coffee, would it be less likely to see dark room if the person did not drink coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of the candle on room is that it makes the room more likely to be dark. The probability of a dark room for people who drink coffee is 50%, which is lower than the 84% probability for people who do not drink coffee. This suggests that the direct effect of coffee on room counteracts the direct effect of the candle on room, making the room less likely to be dark. If the person did not drink coffee, the direct effect of the candle on room would not be counteracted, and the room would be more likely to be dark.<|eot_id|>",
