The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 53%. For people refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 38%. For people getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 62%. Is recovering from the disease more likely than dying from the disease overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of someone not getting the vaccine and still recovering from the disease is 0.47 * 0.38 = 0.1794. The probability of someone not getting the vaccine and dying from the disease is 0.47 * (1 - 0.38) = 0.2943. The probability of someone getting the vaccine and still recovering from the disease is 0.53 * 0.62 = 0.3294. The probability of someone getting the vaccine and dying from the disease is 0.53 * (1 - 0.62) = 0.1994. The total probability of someone recovering from the disease is 0.1794 + 0.3294 = 0.5088. The total probability of someone dying from the disease is 0.2943 + 0.1994 = 0.4937. Since 0.5088 is greater than 0.4937, the probability of someone recovering from the disease is higher than the probability of someone dying from the disease.<|eot_id|>",
