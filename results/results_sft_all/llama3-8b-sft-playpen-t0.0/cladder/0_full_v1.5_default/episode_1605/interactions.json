The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 12%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 57%. For captains who execute prisoners, would it be more likely to see the prisoner's death if the captain had ordered the release of the prisoner?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the prisoner's death is determined by the captain's action (release or execution), not by the captain's relationship with the private or the corporal. Since the probability of the prisoner's death is already higher when the captain executes the prisoner (57% vs. 12%), the captain's previous action of releasing the prisoner does not change the probability of the prisoner's death in this scenario.||",
