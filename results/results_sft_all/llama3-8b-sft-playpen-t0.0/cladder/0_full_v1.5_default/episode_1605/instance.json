  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 12%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 57%. For captains who execute prisoners, would it be more likely to see the prisoner's death if the captain had ordered the release of the prisoner?",
