  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 42%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 59%. For infants with smoking mothers, would it be more likely to see high infant mortality if the infant had a nonsmoking mother?",
