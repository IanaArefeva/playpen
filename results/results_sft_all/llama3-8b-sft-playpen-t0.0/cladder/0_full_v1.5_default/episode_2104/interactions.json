The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Method 1: We look directly at how gender correlates with admission status in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to department competitiveness. To understand how gender affects admission status, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The intervening variable of department competitiveness must be accounted for in order to fully understand the relationship between gender and admission status. Method 1 looks at the general relationship between gender and admission status without considering the role of department competitiveness, which could lead to confounding bias and an inaccurate representation of the relationship. In contrast, Method 2 controls for the intervening variable of department competitiveness by examining the relationship between gender and admission status within each department, which provides a more accurate picture of the relationship between the two variables.||",
