The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 4%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 79%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 31%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is also directly influenced by the wife's behavior, which is not directly related to having a brother. Since the probability of having a brother is only 4%, the vast majority of the population does not have a brother. In this case, the probability of the alarm clock ringing is 79% for those without a brother, which far outweighs the 4% of the population that has a brother and rings the alarm at a 31% rate. This means that the overall probability of the alarm clock ringing is still higher than the probability of it being silent, which is 21% (100% - 79%).||",
