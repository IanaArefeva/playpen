The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 43%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 83%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 18%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 53%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 88%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 30%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender negatively affect admission status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the case of male applicants, the probability of admission acceptance is higher than in the case of female applicants, especially when they are both in a competitive department (53% vs. 83%).
