The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 55%. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 74%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 85%. Is freckles more likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of smoking is 55%, this means that 55% of the population is more likely to have freckles than not, while the remaining 45% is less likely to have freckles than not. The higher probability of freckles among smokers than among nonsmokers further skews the overall probability of freckles in the direction of higher likelihood.||",
