The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of having visited England is 58%. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 22%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 62%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of having visited England is 58%, this means that more than half of the population will have a higher probability of high salary than those who have not visited England. The additional information that the probability of high salary is 62% for those who have visited England and 22% for those who have not further supports this conclusion.<|eot_id|>",
