The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of having visited England is 58%. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 22%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 62%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of having visited England is 58%, this means that more than half of the population will have a higher probability of high salary than those who have not visited England. The additional information that the probability of high salary is 62% for those who have visited England and 22% for those who have not further supports this conclusion.||",
