The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 43%. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 42%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 69%. Is black hair more likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of black hair is higher among those with a college degree or higher (69%) than among those without a college degree (42%). This already suggests that black hair is more likely among those with higher education. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 43%, which means that more than half of the population has higher education. Since black hair is more likely among those with higher education, and higher education is more likely than lower education, it follows that black hair is more likely than blond hair overall.<|eot_id|>",
