The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of being able to swim is 45%. The probability of not being able to swim and high exam score is 12%. The probability of being able to swim and high exam score is 39%. Is the chance of high exam score larger when observing being able to swim?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The total probability of having a high exam score is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 51%. The probability of being able to swim is 45%. To find the probability of having a high exam score given that one is able to swim, we need to divide the probability of being able to swim and having a high exam score by the probability of being able to swim, which is 39% / 45% = 0.8667. To find the probability of having a high exam score given that one is not able to swim, we need to divide the probability of not being able to swim and having a high exam score by the probability of not being able to swim, which is 12% / (100% - 45%) = 12% / 55% = 0.2182. Since 0.8667 is larger than 0.2182, the chance of a high exam score is larger when not being able to swim.<|eot_id|>",
