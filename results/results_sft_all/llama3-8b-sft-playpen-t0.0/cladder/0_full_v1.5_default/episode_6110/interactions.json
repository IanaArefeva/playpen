The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. We know that having visited England and high skill level causes white-collar job. having visited England or high skill level or white-collar job causes high salary. We observed the person has a high skill level. Would the employee has a high salary if not having visited England instead of having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since having a white-collar job is a direct result of having a high skill level, and white-collar job is associated with a high salary, we can conclude that the person would still have a high salary even if they hadn't visited England.
