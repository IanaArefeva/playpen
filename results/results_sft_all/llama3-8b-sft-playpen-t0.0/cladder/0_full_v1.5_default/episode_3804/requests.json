The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of being able to swim is 49%. For students who cannot swim, the probability of high exam score is 32%. For students who can swim, the probability of high exam score is 88%. Is high exam score more likely than low exam score overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The exam score is still more likely to be high than low for those who can swim, but the overall probability of being able to swim is only 49%, which means that the majority of students (51%) will not have a high exam score.<|eot_id|>",
