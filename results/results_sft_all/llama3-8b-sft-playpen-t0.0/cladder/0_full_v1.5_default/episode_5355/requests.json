The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on relationship status. Appearance has a direct effect on relationship status. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 16%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of attractive appearance is 90%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of attractive appearance is 90%. Is attractive appearance more likely than unattractive appearance overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of unattractive appearance is the sum of the individual probabilities: 16% (for those who like spicy food) + 10% (for those who do not like spicy food) = 26%. In contrast, the probability of attractive appearance is 90% for those who like spicy food and 90% for those who do not like spicy food, so the overall probability of attractive appearance is 16% (for those who like spicy food) + 90% (for those who do not like spicy food) = 106%. Since 106% is not a valid probability, we must conclude that the 16% who like spicy food are not accounted for in the 90% who have an attractive appearance. This means that the 16% who like spicy food must have an unattractive appearance, which further increases the overall probability of unattractive appearance to 26% (16% for those who like spicy food and 10% for those who do not like spicy food).<|eot_id|>",
