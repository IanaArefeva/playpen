The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. Method 1: We look directly at how hospital costs correlates with recovery in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to age. To understand how hospital costs affects recovery, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the direct effect of hospital costs on recovery is not being isolated from the potential confounding effect of age. In other words, the relationship between hospital costs and recovery is being muddled by the fact that older people (with higher hospital costs) are also more likely to have higher hospital costs, which in turn affects their recovery. To get a more accurate picture of how hospital costs affects recovery, we need to control for the confounding variable of age, which is exactly what Method 2 does by looking at the relationship between hospital costs and recovery on a case-by-case basis according to age.||",
