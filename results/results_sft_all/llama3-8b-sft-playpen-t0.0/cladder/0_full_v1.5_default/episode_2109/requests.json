Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 12%. The probability of non-male gender and admission acceptance is 65%. The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 4%. Is the chance of admission acceptance larger when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of male gender is 12%, and the probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 4%, we can conclude that the chance of admission acceptance is not larger when observing male gender.<|eot_id|>",
