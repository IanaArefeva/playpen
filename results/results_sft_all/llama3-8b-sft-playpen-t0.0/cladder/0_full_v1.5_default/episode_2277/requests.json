Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 93%. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 40%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 74%.

Since the probability of smoking is 93%, the overall probability of college admission is a weighted average of the two probabilities, with the weight being the probability of smoking (0.93) and the probability of not smoking (0.07). The overall probability of college admission is then 0.93 * 0.74 + 0.07 * 0.4 = 0.69. The probability of college rejection is 1 - 0.69 = 0.31. Since 0.69 is less than 0.5, college admission is less likely than college rejection overall.<|eot_id|>",
