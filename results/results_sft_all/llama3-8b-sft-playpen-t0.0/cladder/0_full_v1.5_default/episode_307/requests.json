The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 49%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 39%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 4%. Is arriving to school on time less likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this case, the probability of Alice arriving to school on time is (1 - 0.49) * 0.39 + 0.49 * 0.04 = 0.26. The probability of Alice arriving to school late is 0.49. Since 0.26 is less than 0.49, it is more likely for Alice to arrive to school late than on time.<|eot_id|>",
