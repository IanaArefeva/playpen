The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 4%. The probability of alarm not set by husband and ringing alarm is 74%. The probability of alarm set by husband and ringing alarm is 1%. Is the chance of ringing alarm larger when observing alarm set by husband?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The total probability of the alarm ringing is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 1% + 74% = 75%. The probability of the alarm set by the husband is 4%. The chance of the alarm ringing is larger than the chance of the alarm being set by the husband, and this is not dependent on whether the alarm is set by the husband or not.<|eot_id|>",
