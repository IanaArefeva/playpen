The candle has a direct effect on room. We know that blowing out the candle or candle with wax causes dark room. We observed the candle has wax. Would the room is bright if not blowing out the candle instead of blowing out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of the candle on the room is also not fully specified, so we can't conclude that the candle's actions will always lead to a bright room. The only thing we know is that the candle has a direct effect on the room and that the candle has wax, which we also know is associated with a dark room.
