The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 90%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 19%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 69%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The higher probability of high salary among those with a brother (69%) compared to those without a brother (19%) further supports this positive relationship. Since the probability of having a brother is 90%, the overall likelihood of high salary is also higher than that of low salary, given the positive causal chain from having a brother to skill to salary.||",
