The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 49%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 84%. For days when Alice wakes up late, would it be more likely to see arriving to school on time if Alice had gotten up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the condition of Alice waking up late is associated with a higher probability of her arriving to school on time. If we condition on the event that Alice wakes up late, the probability of her arriving to school on time remains the same (84%). In other words, the knowledge that Alice woke up on time does not change the probability of her arriving to school on time when she is already known to have woken up late.<|eot_id|>",
