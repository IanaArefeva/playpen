Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of high salary is 30%. For individuals who are male, the probability of high salary is 42%. Will male gender decrease the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of occupation on salary is also positive, meaning that having a particular occupation (likely one that is more lucrative) further increases the probability of having a high salary. Since the direct effect of male gender on occupation is not specified, we must consider the joint effect of male gender and occupation on salary. In this case, the joint probability of male and high occupation is higher than the joint probability of male and high salary, which means that male gender does not directly decrease the chance of high salary.<|eot_id|>",
