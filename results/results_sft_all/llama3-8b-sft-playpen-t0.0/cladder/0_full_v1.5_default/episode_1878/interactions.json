The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 37%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 37%. Will taking medication decrease the chance of healthy heart?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
