Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 37%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 37%. Will taking medication decrease the chance of healthy heart?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The only difference is that medication directly affects blood pressure, but this does not imply that medication directly affects heart condition in a negative way. In fact, the direct relationship between medication and heart condition is neutral, and the relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is also neutral.<|eot_id|>",
