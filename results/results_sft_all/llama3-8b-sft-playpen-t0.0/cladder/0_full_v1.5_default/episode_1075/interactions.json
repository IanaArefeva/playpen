The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 59%. The probability of receives no treatment and recovery is 27%. The probability of receives treatment and recovery is 15%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of recovery is higher when no treatment is given (27%) than when treatment is given (15%). This counterintuitive result is likely due to the specific joint probability of the two variables in this world, which does not support the idea that treatment leads to higher recovery.||",
