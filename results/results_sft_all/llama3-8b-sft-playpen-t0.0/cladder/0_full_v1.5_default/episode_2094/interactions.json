The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 42%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 73%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 44%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 65%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 55%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 1%. Does gender negatively affect admission status through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of being male on admission probability is still present, as male applicants have higher admission probabilities than female applicants in both competitive and non-competitive departments. The intervening variable of department competitiveness does not fully mediate the relationship between gender and admission status, and the direct effect of being male on admission probability remains.||",
