Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. We know that full moon causes rain and sprinkler on. rain or sprinkler on causes wet ground. Would the ground is dry if full moon instead of no full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of full moon on rain supersedes the direct effect of full moon on ground through the intermediate cause rain.
