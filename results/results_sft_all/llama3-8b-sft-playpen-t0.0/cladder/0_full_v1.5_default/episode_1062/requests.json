The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 8%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 22%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 84%. The overall probability of male gender is 47%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The only scenarios where the probability of recovery is lower than the base case (8%) are when the patient is male and not receiving treatment (71% is higher than 8%, so this is not a counterexample), and when the patient is male and receiving treatment (84% is higher than 8%, so this is not a counterexample either). The only remaining scenarios are when the patient is not male and not receiving treatment (8% is the base case), and when the patient is not male and receiving treatment (22% is higher than 8%, so this is not a counterexample). Since the direct effect of treatment on recovery is positive, we can conclude that for patients receiving treatment, it would be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment only if the direct effect of male gender on recovery were negative. In this case, the direct effect of male gender on recovery is positive (71% and 84% are higher than 8% and 22%, respectively), so we conclude that for patients receiving treatment, it would not be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment.<|eot_id|>",
