The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 62%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 47%. Will intelligent parents decrease the chance of being lactose intolerant?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this world, parents' social status has a direct positive effect on their children's health, which likely supersedes the negative effect of parents' intelligence on their children's health. Since children of intelligent parents have a lower probability of being lactose intolerant (47%) compared to children of unintelligent parents (62%), it can be concluded that intelligent parents do not decrease the chance of being lactose intolerant.||",
