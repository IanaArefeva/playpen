The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how smoking correlates with lung cancer case by case according to gender. Method 2: We look directly at how smoking correlates with lung cancer in general. To understand how smoking affects lung cancer, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is a classic case of confounding bias, where the unobserved variable of gender exerts an influence on both the cause (smoking) and the effect (lung cancer), leading to a spurious relationship between the two. To correctly identify the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer, we must control for the intervening variable of tar deposit, which is achieved by looking at the relationship between smoking and lung cancer on a case-by-case basis according to the unobserved variable of gender (Method 1).<|eot_id|>",
