The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 18%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 46%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 61%. Is high infant mortality more likely than low infant mortality overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since health condition is unobserved, we must consider its potential impact on the relationship between maternal smoking and infant mortality. If health condition is associated with both higher birth weight and lower infant mortality, then the higher probability of high infant mortality among smoking mothers might be partially explained by their health condition rather than their smoking behavior. In this case, the direct effect of health condition on birth weight and infant mortality could lead to an underestimation of the true effect of maternal smoking on infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
