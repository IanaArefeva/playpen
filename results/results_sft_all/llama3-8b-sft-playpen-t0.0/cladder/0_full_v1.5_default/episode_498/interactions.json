The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 52%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 16%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 16%. Is talent less likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
