The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 92%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 29%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 56%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The higher probability of high salary among those with a brother (56%) compared to those without a brother (29%) further supports this positive relationship. Since the probability of having a brother is 92%, the large majority of the population will have a brother, which in turn will lead to a higher likelihood of high salary. This suggests that high salary is more likely than low salary overall.<|eot_id|>",
