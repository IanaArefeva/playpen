Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 61%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 81%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be more likely to see high salary if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that having a college degree or higher is already associated with a higher likelihood of high salary. If we condition on having a college degree or higher, the additional information that the person did not have a college degree would not change the probability of high salary, which remains at 81%.<|eot_id|>",
