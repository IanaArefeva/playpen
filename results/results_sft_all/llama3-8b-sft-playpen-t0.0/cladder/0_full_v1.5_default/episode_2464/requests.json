The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 95%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 73%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 22%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 0%. The overall probability of old age is 52%. Will high hospital bill increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

For young patients, a high hospital bill actually decreases the probability of recovery (73% vs 95%). In contrast, for old patients, a high hospital bill has no effect on recovery (0% vs 22%). Since the overall probability of old age is 52%, the positive effect of a high hospital bill on recovery among older patients is overwhelmed by the negative effect among younger patients.<|eot_id|>",
