The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 24%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 32%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since health condition is unobserved and has a direct effect on both birth weight and freckles, we need to consider its potential impact. If health condition is associated with lower birth weight, then the higher probability of freckles among infants with smoking mothers might be due to the lower birth weight rather than the direct effect of smoking. In this case, the increase in the probability of freckles among infants with smoking mothers could be spurious and not directly caused by the smoking itself.||",
