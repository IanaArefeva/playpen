The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of having visited England is 39%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 22%. For people who have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 60%. Is employee being fired less likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since having visited England directly affects the probability of the employee being fired (60% vs 22% for those who haven't), we need to consider the overall probability of having visited England (39%) and its impact on the probability of the employee being fired. If we condition on having visited England, the probability of the employee being fired is 60%, which is higher than the 22% probability for those who haven't. This suggests that having visited England actually increases the likelihood of the employee being fired. Since 39% of the population has already been \"exposed\" to this higher risk condition (having visited England), we must account for this when evaluating the overall probability of the employee being fired. The correct approach involves considering the joint probability of the CEO's action and the subsequent chain of effects leading to the employee being fired. In this case, the direct relationship between having visited England and the probability of the employee being fired means that we should condition on this variable when assessing the overall likelihood of the employee being fired. Conditioning on having visited England, we see that the probability of the employee being fired is 60%, which is higher than the 22% probability for those who haven't. This indicates that the overall probability of the employee being fired is likely higher than the probability of the employee not being fired, especially given the direct relationship between having visited England and the probability",
