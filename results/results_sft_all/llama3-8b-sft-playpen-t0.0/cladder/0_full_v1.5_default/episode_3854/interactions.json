The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of male gender is 41%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 43%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 47%. Is being allergic to peanuts less likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional information that male gender is present in 41% of the population further solidifies this relationship. The direct relationship between department competitiveness and a higher probability of being allergic to peanuts also doesn't change the overall likelihood of being allergic to peanuts. The key point is that the higher probability of being male (41%) already shifts the balance in the opposite direction of what you're looking for, so the additional details about the relationship between male and the probability of being allergic to peanuts further solidify this shift.||",
