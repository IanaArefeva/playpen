The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Method 1: We look directly at how listening to jazz correlates with lung cancer in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to tar deposit. To understand how listening to jazz affects lung cancer, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In other words, the effect of jazz on lung cancer is entirely channeled through its effect on tar deposit. If we look at the relationship between jazz and lung cancer without accounting for the intervening role of tar deposit, we risk misattributing the cause of lung cancer. In this case, looking at the relationship case by case according to tar deposit (Method 2) allows us to control for the intervening variable and more accurately identify the direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer.||",
