The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of having a sister is 54%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 42%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 60%. Is healthy heart less likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of having a sister is 54%, and for those who have a sister, the probability of a healthy heart is 60%. This means that a large proportion of the population (46%) does not have a sister, and among them, the probability of a healthy heart is only 42%. In this context, the overall probability of a healthy heart is likely to be lower than that of heart problems, since the higher probability of heart problems among those without a sister (58%) likely outweighs the higher probability of a healthy heart among those with a sister (60%).<|eot_id|>",
