The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Method 1: We look at how Alice waking up correlates with Alice arriving to school case by case according to traffic. Method 2: We look directly at how Alice waking up correlates with Alice arriving to school in general. To understand how Alice waking up affects Alice arriving to school, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is because we are looking for the direct effect of Alice waking up on Alice arriving to school, and the direct relationship between the two is not confounded by any intervening variable like traffic. In this isolated system, the direct relationship between Alice waking up and Alice arriving to school is the only relevant relationship, and looking at the general correlation between the two (Method 2) is the most appropriate approach to identify this direct effect.<|eot_id|>",
