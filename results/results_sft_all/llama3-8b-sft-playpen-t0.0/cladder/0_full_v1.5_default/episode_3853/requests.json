The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 75%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 37%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 72%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 21%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 85%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 49%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender negatively affect peanut allergy?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the case of male individuals, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is lower than in the case of female individuals. For male individuals, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 21% in a competitive department and 72% in a non-competitive department, which is lower than the corresponding probabilities for female individuals (37% and 75%, respectively).<|eot_id|>",
