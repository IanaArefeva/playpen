The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 8%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 75%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 16%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that only a small fraction of the population (8%) has a brother, and among them, the probability of an alarm clock ringing is still relatively low (16%). In contrast, for the remaining 92% of the population who do not have a brother, the probability of an alarm clock ringing is 75%. Since the large majority of the population does not have a brother, and among them the probability of an alarm clock ringing is higher than among those who do have a brother, the overall probability of an alarm clock ringing is likely to be higher than the probability of a silent alarm.<|eot_id|>",
