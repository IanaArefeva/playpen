Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. We know that male gender causes competitive department. male gender and competitive department causes being allergic to peanuts.

Since male gender directly affects the competitive department, and the competitive department in turn affects the likelihood of being allergic to peanuts, we need to consider the chain of causality. If we change the starting point from male to non-male, we must examine whether this change would still lead to the same final outcome of being allergic to peanuts. In this case, the direct relationship between male and competitive department remains, and the competitive department still exerts its direct effect on the likelihood of being allergic to peanuts. Since the chain of causality remains unbroken, we can conclude that the final outcome of being allergic to peanuts remains the same, and the applicant is still likely to be allergic to peanuts, even if the starting point is non-male rather than male.<|eot_id|>",
