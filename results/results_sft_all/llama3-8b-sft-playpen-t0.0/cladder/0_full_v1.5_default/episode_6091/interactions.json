The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. We know that male gender causes competitive department. male gender and competitive department causes being allergic to peanuts. Would the applicant is allergic to peanuts if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since male gender directly affects the competitive department, and the competitive department in turn affects the likelihood of being allergic to peanuts, we need to consider the chain of causality. If we change the starting point from male to non-male, we must examine whether this change would still lead to the same final outcome of being allergic to peanuts. In this case, the direct relationship between male and competitive department remains, and the competitive department still exerts its direct effect on the likelihood of being allergic to peanuts. Since the chain of causality remains unbroken, we can conclude that the final outcome of being allergic to peanuts remains the same, and the applicant is still likely to be allergic to peanuts, even if the starting point is non-male rather than male.||",
