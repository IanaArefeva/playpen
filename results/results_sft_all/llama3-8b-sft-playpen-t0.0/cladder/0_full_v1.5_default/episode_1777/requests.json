Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 99%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 66%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 24%. Is tanned skin less likely than pale skin overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
