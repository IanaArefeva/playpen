Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 51%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 49%. Will drinking coffee decrease the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of the wife on the alarm clock is an increase in the probability of the alarm clock ringing. Since the direct effect of the coffee on the alarm clock is opposite to the direct effect of the wife on the alarm clock, the overall effect of the coffee on the alarm clock is an increase in the probability of the alarm clock ringing, not a decrease.<|eot_id|>",
