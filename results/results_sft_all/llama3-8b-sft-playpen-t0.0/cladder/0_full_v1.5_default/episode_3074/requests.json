The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. We know that smoking mother and good health causes normal infant birth weight. smoking mother and good health and normal infant birth weight causes high infant mortality. We observed the person has good health. Would infant mortality is high if nonsmoking mother instead of smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the person is a nonsmoking mother, we can conclude that she has normal birth weight. With normal birth weight and good health, we can conclude that the person's infant has normal birth weight. Since the person's health condition is unobserved, we can't conclude that the person's health condition is bad. In this case, the person's health condition is likely to be good. With normal birth weight and likely good health condition, we can conclude that the person's infant has normal birth weight and likely normal health condition. Since the person's health condition is likely to be good, we can conclude that the person's infant has normal birth weight and likely normal health condition, which is associated with normal infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
