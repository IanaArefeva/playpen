The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. The overall probability of encouragement is 85%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of brown eyes is 69%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of brown eyes is 47%. Is brown eyes more likely than blue eyes overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of brown eyes is lower for students who are encouraged (47%) than for those who are not (69%). This suggests that the positive effect of encouragement on brown eyes is offset by the negative effect of encouragement on brown eyes through its positive effect on studying habits.||",
