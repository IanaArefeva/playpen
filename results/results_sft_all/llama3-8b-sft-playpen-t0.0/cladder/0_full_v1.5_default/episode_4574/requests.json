The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 17%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 84%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 20%. Is ringing alarm less likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that 3.4% of the population (17% of the 20% who ring their alarm) ring their alarm and have a brother. The remaining 16.6% of the population who ring their alarm do not have a brother. Additionally, 84% of the 83% of the population who do not have a brother ring their alarm, which is 70.32%. The total number of people who ring their alarm is 3.4% (with a brother) + 70.32% (without a brother) = 73.72%. The number of people who have a brother and ring their alarm is 3.4%, and the number of people who do not have a brother and ring their alarm is 70.32%. The number of people who have a brother and do not ring their alarm is 16.4% (17% of the 95.5% who do not ring their alarm), and the number of people who do not have a brother and do not ring their alarm is 12.68% (16.5% of the 95.5% who do not ring their alarm).
