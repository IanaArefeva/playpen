The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 77%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 47%. For infants with smoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 79%. For infants with smoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 36%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 67%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 64%. For infants with smoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 34%. For infants with smoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 20%. The overall probability of good health is 57%. Does maternal smoking status positively affect freckles through infant's birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between birth weight and freckles is what primarily affects the probability of freckles. The different probabilities of freckles across different groups (nonsmoking mothers with normal birth weight, smoking mothers with normal birth weight, and so on) indicate that the birth weight of the infant is the primary factor determining the probability of freckles, rather than the maternal smoking status directly.||",
