Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of male gender is 16%. The probability of non-male gender and being lactose intolerant is 51%. The probability of male gender and being lactose intolerant is 1%. Is the chance of being lactose intolerant larger when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Additionally, the direct relationship between male gender and department competitiveness is not provided, which further muddles the connection between male gender and lactose intolerance. The more direct and strong relationship is between department competitiveness and lactose intolerance, which is not directly related to male gender. The probability of being lactose intolerant is higher when not observing male gender (51% vs 1%), which suggests that the chance of being lactose intolerant is larger when not observing male gender.<|eot_id|>",
