Skill has a direct effect on salary. We know that college degree or higher causes high skill level, and we know that high skill level causes high salary. Would the employee has a high salary if high school degree or lower instead of college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between skill level and salary means that having a high skill level directly leads to a high salary. Since we are asked whether the employee would have a high salary if they have a high school degree or lower, we need to consider the chain of causality: college degree or higher (causes) high skill level (causes) high salary. If we start with a high school degree or lower, we would not have a college degree or higher, which means we would not have a high skill level, and therefore we would not have a high salary.<|eot_id|>",
