The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 12%. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 54%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of lung cancer is 64% for those who do smoke (and also for those who do not smoke), and the probability of lung cancer is 54% for those who do not smoke, we can conclude that the probability of lung cancer is lower than the probability of absence of lung cancer for those who do not smoke. Since the probability of not smoking is higher than the probability of smoking, the overall probability of lung cancer is lower than the probability of absence of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
