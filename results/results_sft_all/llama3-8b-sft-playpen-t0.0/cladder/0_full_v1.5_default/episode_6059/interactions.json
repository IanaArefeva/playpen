The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. We know that college degree or higher causes high skill level, and we know that high skill level causes blond hair. Would the employee has blond hair if high school degree or lower instead of college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the question is about the counterfactual situation where the person has a high school degree or lower, we need to consider whether this lower educational level would still lead to a high skill level. The direct relationship between educational level and skill level does not imply that lower educational levels lead to higher skill levels. In fact, it is likely that lower educational levels lead to lower skill levels. Since we are looking at a counterfactual situation where the person has a lower educational level, we should conclude that the person is less likely to have a high skill level, and therefore less likely to have blond hair.||",
