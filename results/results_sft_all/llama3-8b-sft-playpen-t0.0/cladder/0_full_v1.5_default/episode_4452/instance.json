Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not listen to jazz and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 30%. For people who do not listen to jazz and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 67%. For people who listen to jazz and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 20%. For people who listen to jazz and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 63%. For people who do not listen to jazz and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 33%. For people who do not listen to jazz and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 65%. For people who listen to jazz and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 53%. For people who listen to jazz and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 96%. The overall probability of high pollution is 55%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would listening to jazz negatively affect lung cancer?",
