The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 54%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 26%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 79%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 51%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 37%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 46%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 76%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 85%. The overall probability of confounder active is 48%. Does parents' intelligence negatively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is not fully captured by the given probabilities, which instead reveal a more complex interaction between parents' intelligence, social status, and the confounder. The probability of an intelligent child given intelligent parents and high social status (51%) is lower than the probability of an intelligent child given intelligent parents and low social status (79%), which suggests that parents' social status may play a role in mediating the relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
