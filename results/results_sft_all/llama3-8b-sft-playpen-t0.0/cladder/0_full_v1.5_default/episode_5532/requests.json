The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on full moon and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on full moon. Full moon has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 36%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 37%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of full moon is 62%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of full moon is 67%. Will full moon increase the chance of increased price?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between yield per acre and full moon is also present. The probability of full moon is higher for both farm types (reduced yield: 62%, increased yield: 67%). The probability of an increased price is higher for the farm type with an increased yield (37%) than for the farm type with a reduced yield (36%). This suggests that the farm type with an increased yield is more likely to have an associated demand that directly affects the price, rather than the full moon. Since the farm type with an increased yield is more likely to have an associated demand that directly affects the price, the full moon is not likely to increase the chance of an increased price.<|eot_id|>",
