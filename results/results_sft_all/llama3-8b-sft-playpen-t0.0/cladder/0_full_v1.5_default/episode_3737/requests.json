The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drinking coffee and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 61%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of high salary is 27%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of high salary is 58%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The unobserved confounder's negative effect on coffee consumption likely skews the overall probability of higher salary, making it less likely than lower salary.<|eot_id|>",
