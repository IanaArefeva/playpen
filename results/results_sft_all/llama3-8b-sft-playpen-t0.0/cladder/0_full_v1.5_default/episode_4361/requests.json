The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 58%. The probability of nonsmoking and being allergic to peanuts is 15%. The probability of smoking and being allergic to peanuts is 39%. Is the chance of being allergic to peanuts smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher when smoking (39%) than when not smoking (15%), and the probability of being both smoking and allergic to peanuts is higher than the probability of being both not smoking and allergic to peanuts, we can conclude that the chance of being allergic to peanuts is larger when observing smoking.<|eot_id|>",
