The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 54%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 69%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be more likely to see high salary if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This indicates that having a college degree or higher directly contributes to a higher likelihood of having a high salary. If we consider a person with a college degree or higher and then remove the college degree condition, we are left with a person who still has a college degree but is now subject to the lower probability of 54% associated with not having a college degree. Since this person still has a college degree, their probability of having a high salary should remain higher than 54%.||",
