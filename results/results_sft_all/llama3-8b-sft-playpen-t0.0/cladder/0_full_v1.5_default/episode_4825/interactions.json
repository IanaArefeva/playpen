The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. For people who do not speak english, the probability of the forest on fire is 83%. For people who speak english, the probability of the forest on fire is 48%. Will speaking english increase the chance of the forest on fire?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
