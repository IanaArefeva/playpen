The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 40%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 83%. For captains who execute prisoners, would it be more likely to see the prisoner's death if the captain had ordered the release of the prisoner?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional information that the captain ordered the release of the prisoner does not change the fact that the captain still ordered the execution of the prisoner, which is associated with a higher risk of death. In this specific context, the action of the captain (executing the prisoner) directly affects the probability of the prisoner's death, and the intervening action of the captain (releasing the prisoner) does not reduce this risk.||",
