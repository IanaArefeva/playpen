The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. We know that having a brother causes having smallpox and no vaccine reaction. having smallpox or severe vaccination reaction causes smallpox survival. Would the person dies from smallpox if not having a brother instead of having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If the person does not have a brother, they will not have smallpox, and without smallpox, they will not have a vaccine reaction. Since having a vaccine reaction is a direct cause of smallpox survival, the absence of a vaccine reaction means that the person will not survive smallpox.||",
