The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 55%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 47%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 13%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 7%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 77%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 54%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 43%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 20%. The overall probability of confounder active is 48%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is not isolated from the confounding variable. The probability of intelligent child is higher when parents have both high intelligence and high social status than when parents have only high intelligence and low social status, which suggests that the positive effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is partially offset by the negative effect of parents' social status.<|eot_id|>",
