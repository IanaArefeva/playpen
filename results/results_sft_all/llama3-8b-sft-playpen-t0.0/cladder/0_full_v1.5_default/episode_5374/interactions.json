The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 19%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 65%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 42%. Is being lactose intolerant less likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The overall probability of being lactose intolerant is the weighted average of these two probabilities, where the weights are the probabilities of having intelligent and unintelligent parents. The probability of having intelligent parents is 0.19, and the probability of having unintelligent parents is 1 - 0.19 = 0.81. The overall probability of being lactose intolerant is then 0.19 * 0.42 + 0.81 * 0.65 = 0.5283, which is less than 0.5, meaning that being lactose intolerant is less likely than not being lactose intolerant overall.||",
