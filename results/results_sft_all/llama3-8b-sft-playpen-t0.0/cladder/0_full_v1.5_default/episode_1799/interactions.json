The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and penguin survival. Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin death is 70%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin death is 29%. Will taking the elevator increase the chance of penguin death?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only quantified relationships are between my decision and penguin death, and between penguin mood and penguin death. Since the probability of penguin death is lower when I take the elevator (29%) than when I take the stairs (70%), and there is no direct link between my decision and penguin mood, I conclude that taking the elevator will not increase the chance of penguin death.||",
