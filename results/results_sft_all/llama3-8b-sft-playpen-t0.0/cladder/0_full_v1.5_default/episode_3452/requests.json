The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of solar eclipse is 81%. The probability of no solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 11%. The probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 19%. Is the chance of arriving to school on time smaller when observing solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 19% (81% chance of solar eclipse * 0.2 chance of on-time arrival given solar eclipse) and the probability of no solar eclipse and on-time arrival is 11%. The probability of on-time arrival given solar eclipse is higher than the probability of on-time arrival given no solar eclipse (0.2 > 0.1), which means that the chance of arriving to school on time is larger when observing solar eclipse.<|eot_id|>",
