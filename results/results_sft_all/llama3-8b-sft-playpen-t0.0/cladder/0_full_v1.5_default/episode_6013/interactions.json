The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. We know that tanning salon treatment or going to the beach causes large feet. We observed the person does not go to the beach. Would the person has small feet if no tanning salon treatment instead of tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we know that tanning salon treatment or going to the beach causes large feet, and we also know that the person does not go to the beach, we can conclude that the person's large foot size is due to the tanning salon treatment. If we were to remove the tanning salon treatment, we would still be left with the beach as a potential cause of large foot size, since the person does not go to the beach, we can conclude that the person's large foot size is still present, and the absence of tanning salon treatment would not change the person's foot size.||",
