The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. Method 1: We look at how full moon correlates with ground case by case according to sprinkler. Method 2: We look directly at how full moon correlates with ground in general. To understand how full moon affects ground, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct link between full moon and weather, and the direct link between weather and ground, imply that the full moon exerts a direct influence on the ground condition. In this case, looking at the general relationship between full moon and ground (Method 2) is more appropriate than relying on the intermediate variable \"sprinkler\" (Method 1) to establish the connection.||",
