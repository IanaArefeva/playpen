The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of having a sister is 91%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 38%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 25%. Is healthy heart less likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having a sister is 91%, which means that 9% of the population does not have a sister. For this 9%, the probability of a healthy heart is 38%. In contrast, for the 91% who do have a sister, the probability of a healthy heart is 25%. Since the 9% without a sister already has a higher probability of a healthy heart than the 91% with a sister, we can conclude that the overall probability of a healthy heart is higher than that of heart problems.||",
