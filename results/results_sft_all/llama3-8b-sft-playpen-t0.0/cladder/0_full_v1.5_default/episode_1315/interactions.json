The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 86%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 48%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 17%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 30%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 52%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 60%. The overall probability of high pollution is 44%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would gene negatively affect lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
