Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 44%. For smokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 62%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see being lactose intolerant if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key relationship is between being a smoker and the probability of being lactose intolerant, which is higher than for nonsmokers. The direct relationship between being a smoker and being lactose intolerant is not the primary cause of being lactose intolerant; rather, it's the higher probability of being lactose intolerant when being a smoker that's the main issue.
