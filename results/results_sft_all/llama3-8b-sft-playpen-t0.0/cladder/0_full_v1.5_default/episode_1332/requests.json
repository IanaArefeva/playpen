The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 37%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 50%. Will smoking gene decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The \"unobserved\" (pollution) variable likely exerts a direct positive effect on both \"smoking\" and \"lung cancer\". In this setting, the \"smoking\" and \"Gene\" variables are not direct causes of \"lung cancer\" but rather intermediate variables that are influenced by the \"unobserved\" (pollution) variable.
