The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 77%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 26%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 45%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 63%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 37%. The overall probability of smoking is 39%. Does smoking positively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not fully captured by the given probabilities, which focus on the joint effects of smoking and tar deposit on lung cancer. The correct approach is to examine the joint probability of smoking and high tar deposit, then consider the separate probabilities of lung cancer for those with and without high tar deposit. The joint probability of smoking and high tar deposit is 26% (39% of 26% from the table), and the probability of lung cancer for those with high tar deposit is 45% (45% of 26% from the table). In comparison, the probability of lung cancer for those without high tar deposit is 71% (71% of 77% from the table), which is higher than the 45% associated with high tar deposit. This indicates that the positive relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not fully accounted for by the intervening variable of tar deposit, and that there is an additional direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer that is not fully captured by the given data.||",
