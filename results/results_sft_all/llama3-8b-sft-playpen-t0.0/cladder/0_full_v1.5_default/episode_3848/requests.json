The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 72%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 84%. For individuals who are male, would it be less likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The additional condition that being male has a direct effect on department competitiveness and that this, in turn, has a direct effect on the probability of being allergic to peanuts does not change the direct relationship between being male and having a higher probability of being allergic to peanuts.<|eot_id|>",
