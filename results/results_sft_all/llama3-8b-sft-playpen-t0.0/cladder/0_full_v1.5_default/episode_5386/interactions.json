The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how parents' intelligence correlates with lactose intolerance case by case according to parents' social status. Method 2: We look directly at how parents' intelligence correlates with lactose intolerance in general. To understand how parents' intelligence affects lactose intolerance, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that parents' social status acts as a confounding variable that can lead to spurious correlations between parents' intelligence and lactose intolerance. If we use Method 1, we are still subject to the risk of confounding by social status, as we are looking at the relationship between parents' intelligence and lactose intolerance within subgroups of parents by social status. In other words, social status still exerts its influence on both the dependent and independent variables, which can lead to bias in the estimated relationship between parents' intelligence and lactose intolerance. In contrast, Method 2 directly looks at the relationship between parents' intelligence and lactose intolerance in general, without relying on subgroups by social status. This approach is more likely to reveal the true causal relationship between parents' intelligence and lactose intolerance, as it controls for the confounding effect of social status.||",
