Effort has a direct effect on freckles. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of freckles is 68%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of freckles is 45%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of freckles is 84%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of freckles is 33%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 19%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 58%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect freckles?",
