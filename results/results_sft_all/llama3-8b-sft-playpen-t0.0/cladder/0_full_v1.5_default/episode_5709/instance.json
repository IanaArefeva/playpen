Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 81%. The probability of not having a sister and high infant mortality is 13%. The probability of having a sister and high infant mortality is 44%.
