The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 14%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 49%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 32%. Is intelligent child more likely than unintelligent child overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The total probability of an intelligent child is 0.0448 + 0.4214 = 0.4662. The probability of an unintelligent child is 1 - 0.4662 = 0.5338.
