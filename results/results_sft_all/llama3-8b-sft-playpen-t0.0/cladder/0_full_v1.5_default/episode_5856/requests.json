The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of having a sister is 15%. The probability of not having a sister and lung cancer is 55%. The probability of having a sister and lung cancer is 13%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of having a sister is 15% and the probability of having a sister and lung cancer is 13%, the direct relationship between having a sister and lung cancer is not strong. In fact, the probability of having a sister and lung cancer is lower than the probability of not having a sister and lung cancer (55%). This suggests that having a sister does not increase the chance of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
