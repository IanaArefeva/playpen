The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. Method 1: We look at how having a brother correlates with salary case by case according to skill. Method 2: We look directly at how having a brother correlates with salary in general. To understand how having a brother affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If we want to understand how having a brother affects salary, we need to account for the intervening variable \"skill\". Method 1 controls for this intervening variable by looking at how having a brother correlates with salary case by case according to skill. In contrast, Method 2 looks at the direct relationship between having a brother and salary without considering the intervening variable \"skill\", which could lead to confounding bias and an inaccurate estimate of the effect of having a brother on salary.||",
