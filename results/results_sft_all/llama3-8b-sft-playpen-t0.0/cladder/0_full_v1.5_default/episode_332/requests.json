Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 3%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 27%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 81%. Is tanned skin more likely than pale skin overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of tanning salon treatment is 3%, the overall probability of tanned skin is 3% (3% of 3%) + 27% (97% of 27%) = 3.09%. In comparison, the probability of pale skin is 1 - 3.09% = 96.91%. Therefore, tanned skin is less likely than pale skin overall.<|eot_id|>",
