Cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Having a brother has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved.

For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of having a brother is 6%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of having a brother is 49%. Will having a brother decrease the chance of normal infant birth weight?",
