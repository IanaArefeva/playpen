The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. We know that obesity and smoker causes having diabetes. obesity or smoker or having diabetes causes long lifespan. We observed the person is a nonsmoker. Would the person has a short lifespan if normal weight instead of obesity?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
