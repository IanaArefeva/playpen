The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 92%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 81%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 17%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 5%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 49%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\n\nLet's first consider the counterfactual of a patient with a large kidney stone not receiving treatment. In this case, the probability of recovery is 17%. Now, if we consider the counterfactual of a patient with a large kidney stone who does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 5%. This means that, in both scenarios, the probability of recovery is lower than the probability of recovery for a patient with a small kidney stone (92% and 81%, respectively). This suggests that the direct effect of kidney stone size on recovery is more significant than the direct effect of treatment on recovery.\n\nNext, we need to consider the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone who does not receive treatment. In this case, the probability of recovery is 92%. Now, if we consider the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone who does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 81%. This means that, in both scenarios, the probability of recovery is higher than the probability of recovery for a patient with a large kidney stone (92% and 81%, respectively). This further supports the idea that the direct effect of kidney stone size on recovery is more significant than the direct effect of treatment",
