The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 95%. For patients who have small kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 83%. For patients who have large kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 20%. For patients who have large kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 9%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 41%. Will speaking english increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on ability to speak English is not directly relevant to the question of whether speaking English affects the chance of recovery. The direct effect of ability to speak English on recovery is also not directly relevant, as we are looking for the net effect of speaking English on the chance of recovery, not just its isolated effect. The correct approach is to examine the joint effects of kidney stone size and language skills on the probability of recovery. The table below organizes the given information in a useful way, with the rows corresponding to different kidney stone sizes and the columns corresponding to different language skills (English or not English). The cells contain the corresponding probabilities of recovery.\n> Small kidney stone:  \n> English: 83%  \n> Not English: 95%\n> Large kidney stone:  \n> English: 9%  \n> Not English: 20%\n\nNext, we need to consider the overall probability of large kidney stone, which is 41%. This means that in 41% of the cases, the kidney stone is large, and in 59% of the cases, the kidney stone is small. The table below organizes the information in a useful way, with the rows corresponding to different kidney stone sizes and the columns corresponding to different language skills (English or not English).
