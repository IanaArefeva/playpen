The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on black hair. Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 100%. The probability of no tanning salon treatment and black hair is 0%. The probability of tanning salon treatment and black hair is 33%. Is the chance of black hair smaller when observing tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of going to the beach on black hair is also positive, meaning that going to the beach always leads to black hair. Since the probability of tanning salon treatment is 100%, it is certain that black hair will occur when tanning salon treatment is present. The additional condition that the probability of no tanning salon treatment and black hair is 0% further supports this conclusion, as it rules out any possibility of black hair without tanning salon treatment. Finally, the probability of tanning salon treatment and black hair being 33% does not imply that the chance of black hair is smaller when tanning salon treatment is present, as this probability is still higher than the probability of black hair without tanning salon treatment (0%).||",
