The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 11%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 46%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 78%. Is arriving to school on time less likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of Alice waking up on time is 89% (100% - 11% late), and the probability of Alice arriving on time given that she woke up on time is 46%. The probability of Alice waking up late is 11%, and the probability of Alice arriving on time given that she woke up late is 78%. The overall probability of Alice arriving on time is (0.89 * 0.46) + (0.11 * 0.78) = 0.4094 + 0.0858 = 0.4952. The overall probability of Alice arriving late is 1 - 0.4952 = 0.5048. Since 0.4952 is less than 0.5048, it is less likely for Alice to arrive to school on time than to arrive late.<|eot_id|>",
