The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 11%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 46%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 78%. Is arriving to school on time less likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of Alice waking up on time is 89% (100% - 11% late), and the probability of Alice arriving on time given that she woke up on time is 46%. The probability of Alice waking up late is 11%, and the probability of Alice arriving on time given that she woke up late is 78%. The overall probability of Alice arriving on time is (0.89 * 0.46) + (0.11 * 0.78) = 0.4094 + 0.0858 = 0.4952. The overall probability of Alice arriving late is 1 - 0.4952 = 0.5048. Since 0.4952 is less than 0.5048, it is less likely for Alice to arrive to school on time than to arrive late.||",
