Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For situations where there is no solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 50%. For situations where there is a solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 5%. Will solar eclipse increase the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the solar eclipse acts as a negative intervening variable, decreasing the likelihood of Alice's on-time arrival. The direct effect of the solar eclipse supersedes any potential positive effects that might be associated with it, and its negative impact on Alice's arrival time is not offset by any other factor in this isolated system.<|eot_id|>",
