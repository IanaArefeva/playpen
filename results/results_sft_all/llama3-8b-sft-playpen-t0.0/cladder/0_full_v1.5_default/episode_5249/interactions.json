The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 45%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 64%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 72%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 90%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 27%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 55%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 54%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 82%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 15%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between department competitiveness and freckles is also a direct one, and this relationship can mediate the relationship between gender and freckles. In particular, the higher probability of freckles among male applicants to a competitive department (90%) compared to male applicants to a non-competitive department (72%) suggests that the positive relationship between male and freckles is primarily due to the higher probability of male applicants being in a competitive department, rather than any direct effect of male on freckles.||",
