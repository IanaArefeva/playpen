The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how water quality correlates with cholera in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to poverty. To understand how water quality affects cholera, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this case, looking at the general correlation between water quality and cholera (Method 1) is more appropriate than looking at this relationship case by case according to poverty (Method 2), as the direct relationship between water quality and cholera is not subject to the intervening variable of poverty.||",
