The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how gender correlates with admission status case by case according to department competitiveness. Method 2: We look directly at how gender correlates with admission status in general. To understand how gender affects admission status, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In other words, the relationship between gender and admission status is not direct but rather is mediated by the intervening variable of department competitiveness. This is a classic case of a confounding variable, which can lead to spurious relationships if not accounted for. In this case, if we directly examine the relationship between gender and admission status (Method 2), we risk misattributing the effect of department competitiveness to the relationship between gender and admission status. In contrast, looking at how gender correlates with admission status case by case according to department competitiveness (Method 1) controls for the intervening variable of department competitiveness, providing a more accurate representation of the relationship between gender and admission status.||",
