The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on rainfall. Sprinkler has a direct effect on rainfall. For people in the dry season, the probability of high rainfall is 52%. For in the rainy season, the probability of high rainfall is 58%. For in the rainy season, would it be more likely to see high rainfall if the season had been dry?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
