Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 24%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 50%. Will having a brother increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high salary is higher for those who have a brother (50%) than for those who do not (24%), which might lead one to conclude that having a brother is associated with a higher chance of high salary. However, the direct relationship between having a brother and skill is not quantified, and the intervening variable of skill is not fully accounted for in the given information. A more complete understanding of the relationships between having a brother, skill, and salary is required to conclude that having a brother directly increases the chance of high salary.<|eot_id|>",
