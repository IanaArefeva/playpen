The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 21%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 65%. For captains who execute prisoners, would it be more likely to see the prisoner's death if the captain had ordered the release of the prisoner?",
