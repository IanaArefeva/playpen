The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active and high cigarette tax causes smoking mother. confounder active and smoking mother causes normal infant birth weight. We observed the cigarette tax is high and confounder inactive. Would the infant is born with a normal weight if smoking mother instead of nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we know that the confounder is active and that a high cigarette tax causes a smoking mother, we can conclude that the high cigarette tax is not the direct cause of the normal birth weight in this case. The active confounder must be the cause of the normal birth weight, and since the confounder is active, it must also be the case that the smoking mother is not the direct cause of the normal birth weight. If the smoking mother were the direct cause of the normal birth weight, then the active confounder would not be necessary to explain the normal birth weight. Since we have already established that the active confounder is necessary to explain the normal birth weight, we can conclude that the smoking mother is not the direct cause of the normal birth weight.||",
