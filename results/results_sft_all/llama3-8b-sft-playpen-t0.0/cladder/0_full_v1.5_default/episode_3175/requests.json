Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 24%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 44%. Will drinking coffee decrease the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the direct effect of coffee on the alarm clock is not counteracted by any negative direct or indirect effects through the wife, the overall effect of coffee on the alarm clock is positive, meaning that it will increase the chance of the alarm clock ringing, not decrease it.<|eot_id|>",
