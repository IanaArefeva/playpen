The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 52%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of high salary is 50%. For individuals who are male, the probability of high salary is 73%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, we must consider the joint effects of multiple variables. The direct relationship between occupation and salary further muddies the waters. If we condition on occupation, we see that the probability of high salary is higher for male than for non-male in every occupation. This suggests that the higher probability of high salary among males is not due to a direct effect of male gender on salary, but rather an indirect effect through occupation. Since the probability of male is 52%, and the probability of high salary is 73% for males, we can conclude that the overall probability of high salary is less than 50% (52% * 0.73 < 50%).<|eot_id|>",
