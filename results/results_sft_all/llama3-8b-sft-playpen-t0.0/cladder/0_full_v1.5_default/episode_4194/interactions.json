The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of having a brother is 41%. For patients who do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients who have a brother, the probability of recovery is 24%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of being male on having a brother is positive, as the probability of having a brother is higher for males (41%) than for females (0%). The direct effect of being male on recovery is also positive, as the probability of recovery is higher for males (24%) than for females (0%). Since the direct effects of being male on having a brother and on recovery are both positive, and the direct effect of having a brother on recovery is negative, we conclude that the overall probability of recovery is lower than the probability of non-recovery.||",
