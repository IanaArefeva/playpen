The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 98%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 64%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 79%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The given probabilities of high salary for those with and without a brother (79% and 64%, respectively) already account for the intervening variable of skill. Since the probability of having a brother is 98%, the vast majority of the population will have a brother, which in turn will lead to a higher probability of having a high salary (79%). This does not imply that having a brother directly affects the likelihood of having a high or low salary; rather, it's the skill acquired through having a brother that ultimately affects the salary.||",
