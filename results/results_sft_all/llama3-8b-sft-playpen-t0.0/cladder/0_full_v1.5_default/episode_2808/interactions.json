The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes manager signing the termination letter and director signing the termination letter. manager signing the termination letter or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to retain the employee. Would the employee is not fired if manager signing the termination letter instead of manager not signing the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the CEO's decision to fire the employee directly leads to the manager's action of signing the termination letter, and this action in turn directly leads to the employee's being fired, we can conclude that the manager's action is not a necessary condition for the employee's being fired. In other words, the manager's action is a redundant link in the causal chain. If the manager were to sign the termination letter, it would still lead to the same outcome (the employee being fired) through the direct effect of the CEO's decision.||",
