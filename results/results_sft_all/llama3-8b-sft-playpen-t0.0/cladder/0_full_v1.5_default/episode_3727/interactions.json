The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drinking coffee and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how drinking coffee correlates with salary case by case according to unobserved confounders. Method 2: We look directly at how drinking coffee correlates with salary in general. To understand how drinking coffee affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both drinking coffee and salary, which means that if we directly look at the general relationship between coffee consumption and salary (Method 2), we would be confounding the effect of coffee on salary with the effect of the unobserved confounders. In other words, the general relationship between coffee consumption and salary would be spurious and not reflective of the true causal relationship between the two. Method 1, on the other hand, controls for the unobserved confounders by looking at the relationship between coffee consumption and salary on a case-by-case basis, which would reveal the true direct effect of coffee on salary.||",
