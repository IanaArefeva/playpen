The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of speaking english is 51%. The probability of not speaking english and recovery is 16%. The probability of speaking english and recovery is 38%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of not speaking English is 49% (100% - 51%), we can conclude that the 16% joint probability of not speaking English and recovery is a larger fraction of the 49% than the 38% joint probability of speaking English and recovery is of the 51%.
