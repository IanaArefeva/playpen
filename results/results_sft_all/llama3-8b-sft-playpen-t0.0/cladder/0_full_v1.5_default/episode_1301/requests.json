The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 18%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 17%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 43%. The overall probability of smoking is 49%. Does smoking positively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is not positive; in fact, the probability of lung cancer is lower for smokers with no tar deposit (17%) than for nonsmokers with no tar deposit (46%). The positive relationship between smoking and lung cancer is only through the intermediate variable of tar deposit, which is higher for smokers (64%) than for nonsmokers (18%).<|eot_id|>",
