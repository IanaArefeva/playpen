Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 54%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 92%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 39%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 67%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 32%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 61%. The overall probability of smoking is 14%. Does smoking positively affect peanut allergy through tar deposit?",
