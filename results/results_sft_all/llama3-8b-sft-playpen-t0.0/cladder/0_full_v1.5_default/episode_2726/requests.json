Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 35%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 51%. Does smoking positively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is separate from the direct effect of tar deposit on lung cancer. The increase in lung cancer risk among smokers is not fully accounted for by the increase in tar deposit, which is a separate intervening variable.<|eot_id|>",
