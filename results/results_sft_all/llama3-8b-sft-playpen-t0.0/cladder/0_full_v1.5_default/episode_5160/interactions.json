The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Brown eyes has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 91%. For students who are not talented, the probability of brown eyes is 95%. For students who are talented, the probability of brown eyes is 95%. Is brown eyes less likely than blue eyes overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the overall probability of brown eyes is also 95%, since the two groups account for the entire population. The probability of blue eyes is not directly provided, but we can conclude that it is 5% for both groups, as the remaining fraction of the population must have blue eyes. Since the probability of brown eyes is higher than that of blue eyes in both groups, and the two groups account for the entire population, we can conclude that brown eyes are more likely than blue eyes overall.||",
