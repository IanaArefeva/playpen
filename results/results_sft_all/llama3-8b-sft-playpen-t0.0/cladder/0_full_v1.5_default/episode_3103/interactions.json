The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. We know that smoking gene or high pollution causes smoking. smoking gene or high pollution or smoking causes lung cancer. We observed the person lives in a place with high pollution. Would the person has lung cancer if nonsmoking gene instead of smoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
