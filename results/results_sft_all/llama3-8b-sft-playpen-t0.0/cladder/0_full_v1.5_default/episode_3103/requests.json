Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. We know that smoking gene or high pollution causes smoking. smoking gene or high pollution or smoking causes lung cancer. We observed the person lives in a place with high pollution. Would the person has lung cancer if nonsmoking gene instead of smoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The person's smoking behavior is also directly caused by the high pollution. The person's lung cancer is not directly caused by the person's smoking behavior, but rather by the high pollution. If the person had a nonsmoking gene, it would not change the person's behavior of living in a place with high pollution, and therefore would not change the person's risk of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
