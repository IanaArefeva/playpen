The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of encouragement is 54%. The probability of discouragement and high exam score is 21%. The probability of encouragement and high exam score is 48%. Is the chance of high exam score larger when observing encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
