The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 50%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 64%. For people who play card games, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not play card games?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the only direct relationship is positive, we can conclude that card game play is associated with a higher probability of long lifespan, and that this relationship is not offset by any negative effects through the unobserved variable (smoking) or the intermediate variable (diabetes).||",
