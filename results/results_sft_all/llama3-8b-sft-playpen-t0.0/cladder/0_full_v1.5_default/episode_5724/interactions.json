The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 86%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 51%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 77%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 42%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 76%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 43%. The overall probability of smoking is 82%. Will smoking increase the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of freckles among smokers is 43% when they have a high tar deposit, which is lower than the 77% probability of freckles among nonsmokers with no tar deposit. This suggests that the positive effect of smoking on freckles is offset by the negative effect of high tar deposit. Additionally, the probability of freckles among smokers is 76% when they have no tar deposit, which is higher than the 77% probability of freckles among nonsmokers with no tar deposit. This further blurs the direct relationship between smoking and freckles.||",
