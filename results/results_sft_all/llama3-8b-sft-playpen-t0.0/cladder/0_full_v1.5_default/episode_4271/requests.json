The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 9%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 32%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 75%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 98%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 54%. Will getting the vaccine increase the chance of being lactose intolerant?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of the vaccine on lactose intolerance is positive, meaning that the vaccine increases the probability of being lactose intolerant. However, the pre-conditions have a direct effect on both the vaccine and the probability of being lactose intolerant. In particular, the pre-conditions increase the probability of being lactose intolerant, and they also reduce the probability of being vaccinated (since the vaccine is only available to those without pre-conditions). This means that the positive effect of the vaccine on the probability of being lactose intolerant is offset by the negative effect of the pre-conditions on the probability of being vaccinated. In other words, the vaccine only really matters for those without pre-conditions, and for them, the vaccine does increase the probability of being lactose intolerant. But for those with pre-conditions, the vaccine is not an option, and the probability of being lactose intolerant is already high.<|eot_id|>",
