The correct chain of causality is: Smoking -> high tar deposit -> absence of lung cancer. If the person does not smoke, the chain of causality is: no smoking -> no high tar deposit -> no absence of lung cancer, which still does not imply the person has no lung cancer. The correct chain of causality for the person not having lung cancer is: no smoking -> no high tar deposit -> no absence of lung cancer, which still does not imply the person has no lung cancer. The correct chain of causality for the person having no lung cancer is: no smoking -> no high tar deposit, which still does not imply the person has no lung cancer. The correct chain of causality for the person having no lung cancer is: no smoking, which still does not imply the person has no lung cancer.
