Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 8%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 68%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 56%. Is curly hair less likely than straight hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of curly hair among citrus consumers is lower than among non-consumers (56% vs 68%). This suggests that citrus consumption might actually reduce the likelihood of curly hair. To further disentangle the relationships, we need to consider the joint probability of citrus consumption and curly hair. If we condition on citrus consumption, the probability of curly hair is lower than the unconditioned probability of 68%. This indicates that citrus consumption might be associated with a lower likelihood of curly hair.<|eot_id|>",
