Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 94%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 61%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 34%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 0%. The overall probability of male gender is 48%.
