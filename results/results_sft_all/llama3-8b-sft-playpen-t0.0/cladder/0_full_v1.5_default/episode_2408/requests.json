The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 94%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 61%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 34%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 0%. The overall probability of male gender is 48%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The only counterintuitive result is that male patients who receive treatment have a 0% chance of recovery, which is likely due to some specific interaction between being male and being treated that we're not directly observing. In the absence of any direct interaction between being male and being treated that would reduce the probability of recovery, we can conclude that, for patients who are not male and are being treated, the probability of recovery is still higher than for those who are not being treated.<|eot_id|>",
