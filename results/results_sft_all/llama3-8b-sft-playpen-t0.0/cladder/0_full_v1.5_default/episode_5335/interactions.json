The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 51%. For people who do not drink coffee and non-hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 98%. For people who do not drink coffee and hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 91%. For people who drink coffee and non-hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 99%. For people who drink coffee and hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 94%. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does the chance of broken bones increase when drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
