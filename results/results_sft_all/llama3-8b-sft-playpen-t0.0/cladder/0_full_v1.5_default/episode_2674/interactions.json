The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking gene is 94%. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of having a smoking gene is 0.94, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction to get the overall probability of lung cancer: 0.94 * 0.64 + 0.06 * 0.56 = 0.6094. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.6094 = 0.3906. Since 0.6094  0.3906, lung cancer is more likely than absence of lung cancer for people with the given condition.||",
