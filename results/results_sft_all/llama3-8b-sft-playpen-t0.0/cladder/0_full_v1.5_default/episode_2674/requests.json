The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking gene is 94%. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of having a smoking gene is 0.94, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction to get the overall probability of lung cancer: 0.94 * 0.64 + 0.06 * 0.56 = 0.6094. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.6094 = 0.3906. Since 0.6094 > 0.3906, lung cancer is more likely than absence of lung cancer for people with the given condition.<|eot_id|>",
