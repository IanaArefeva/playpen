The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 81%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 60%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 66%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The given probabilities of high salary for those with and without a brother (66% and 60%, respectively) already account for the intervening variable of skill. Since the probability of having a brother is 81%, the overall probability of high salary is a weighted average of the two scenarios: (0.81 * 0.66) + (0.19 * 0.60) = 0.6489 + 0.114 = 0.7629, which is higher than the probability of having a high salary when not having a brother (0.60). This suggests that having a brother is associated with a higher likelihood of having a high salary, rather than a lower likelihood.||",
