The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 53%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 64%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 80%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 50%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of college degree or higher on high salary is not quantified in the given information. The probability of high salary is higher for people living close to a college (64%) than for those living far from a college (53%), which might imply that living close to a college has a positive effect on the probability of high salary. The probability of college degree or higher is higher for people living far from a college (80%) than for those living close to a college (50%), which might imply that living far from a college has a positive effect on the probability of college degree or higher. The unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both education level and salary, which further complicates the relationship between college degree or higher and high salary.<|eot_id|>",
