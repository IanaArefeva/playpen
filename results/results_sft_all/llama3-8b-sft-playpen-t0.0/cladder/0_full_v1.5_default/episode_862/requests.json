The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 45%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 17%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 30%. Is the chance of intelligent child smaller when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The joint probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 30%, which is higher than the probability of intelligent child (25%) when parents are intelligent. This suggests that the direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is strong enough to counteract the negative effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
