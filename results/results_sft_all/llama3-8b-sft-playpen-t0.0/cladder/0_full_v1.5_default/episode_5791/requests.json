The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 37%. The probability of nonsmoking and freckles is 41%. The probability of smoking and freckles is 26%. Is the chance of freckles larger when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of freckles is also directly related to the probability of not smoking, which is 63%. Since the probability of not smoking is higher than the probability of smoking, and the probability of freckles is higher in the not smoking condition (41% vs 26%), the chance of freckles is larger when not observing smoking.<|eot_id|>",
