Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. We know that vaccination causes having smallpox and severe vaccination reaction. having smallpox or severe vaccination reaction causes smallpox survival.

The direct effect of vaccination on smallpox is that it causes having smallpox, which in turn leads to smallpox survival. If the person were vaccinated, they would likely contract smallpox, which would lead to smallpox survival. In this scenario, the person's smallpox survival is directly caused by having smallpox, rather than by the vaccination itself.<|eot_id|>",
