The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 55%. For people who have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 65%. Will having a brother increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key insight here is that the direct relationship between having a brother and lung cancer is likely a result of the unobserved common cause, which is the unobserved \"pollution\" variable. In other words, the increase in lung cancer probability among those with a brother is likely due to the higher level of pollution they are exposed to, rather than the brother itself. This is a classic example of a confounding variable, where the observed relationship between having a brother and lung cancer is spurious and not causal.||",
