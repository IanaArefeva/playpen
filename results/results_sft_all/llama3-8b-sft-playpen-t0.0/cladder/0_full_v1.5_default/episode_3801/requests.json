The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who cannot swim and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 5%. For students who cannot swim and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 45%. For students who can swim and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 28%. For students who can swim and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 77%. For students who cannot swim, the probability of studying hard is 20%. For students who can swim, the probability of studying hard is 92%. Does ability to swim positively affect exam score through studying habit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key insight here is that the positive effect of ability to swim on exam score is entirely accounted for by the positive effect of ability to swim on studying habits. In other words, the positive relationship between ability to swim and exam score is entirely due to the fact that ability to swim increases the likelihood of studying habits, which in turn affects exam score. If we control for studying habits, the positive relationship between ability to swim and exam score disappears.<|eot_id|>",
