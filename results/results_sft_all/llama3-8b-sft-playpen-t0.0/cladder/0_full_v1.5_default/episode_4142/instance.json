Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how supply correlates with rainfall case by case according to demand. Method 2: We look directly at how supply correlates with rainfall in general. To understand how supply affects rainfall, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?",
