The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and rainfall. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how supply correlates with rainfall case by case according to demand. Method 2: We look directly at how supply correlates with rainfall in general. To understand how supply affects rainfall, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In Method 1, looking at how supply correlates with rainfall case by case according to demand still doesn't account for the direct effect of demand on both supply and rainfall. In Method 2, looking directly at how supply correlates with rainfall in general also doesn't account for the direct effect of demand on both supply and rainfall. In both cases, the unobserved demand variable is confounding the relationship between supply and rainfall, and we need to control for it to get an accurate picture of the relationship between supply and rainfall.||",
