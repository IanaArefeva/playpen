The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 42%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 72%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 42%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 72%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 31%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 80%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being a smoker is higher than that of being a nonsmoker, and the probability of having a high tar deposit is also higher for smokers than for nonsmokers. This means that the observed higher probability of being allergic to peanuts among smokers is likely due to the higher probability of having a high tar deposit, rather than any direct effect of being a smoker on the probability of being allergic to peanuts.<|eot_id|>",
