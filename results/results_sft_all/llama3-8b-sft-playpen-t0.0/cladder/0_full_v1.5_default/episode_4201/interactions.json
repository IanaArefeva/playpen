The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and freckles. Hospital costs has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 45%. For patients who pay a low hospital bill, the probability of freckles is 58%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, the probability of freckles is 18%. Is freckles more likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of a high hospital bill is 45%, this implies that 55% of the time, hospital costs are lower. In those 55% of the time, the probability of freckles is 58%.
