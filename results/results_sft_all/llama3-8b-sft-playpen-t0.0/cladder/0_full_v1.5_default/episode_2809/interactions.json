The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes manager signing the termination letter and director signing the termination letter. manager signing the termination letter or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to fire the employee. Would the employee is fired if manager not signing the termination letter instead of manager signing the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If manager does not sign the termination letter, the chain of causality is broken, and the director will not sign the letter, which means the employee will not be fired.||",
