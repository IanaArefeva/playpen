The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active and close to a college causes college degree or higher. confounder active or college degree or higher causes high salary. We observed the person lives close to a college and confounder active. Would the employee has a high salary if high school degree or lower instead of college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that the person has a college degree or higher, we can conclude that their living close to a college is the cause of this higher education level. If we were to change the person's education level to high school degree or lower, we would be removing the direct effect of living close to a college on their education level. In that case, the only remaining cause of their college degree or higher is the active unobserved confounder. Since we also know that the person has a college degree or higher, we can conclude that the active unobserved confounder is the cause of this higher education level. If we then remove the active unobserved confounder, we would be removing the direct effect of the confounder on the person's education level. In that case, the person's living close to a college would no longer be the cause of their college degree or higher, and their education level would be determined by the direct effect of living close to a college, which is a high school degree or lower. Finally, since the person's living close to a college is the only remaining cause of their college degree or higher, we can conclude that their living close to a college is the cause of their college degree or higher, and their college degree or higher is the cause of their high salary.
