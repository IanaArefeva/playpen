The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on relationship status. Appearance has a direct effect on relationship status. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 17%. For people who do not like spicy food and single people, the probability of attractive appearance is 22%. For people who do not like spicy food and in a relationship, the probability of attractive appearance is 7%. For people who like spicy food and single people, the probability of attractive appearance is 13%. For people who like spicy food and in a relationship, the probability of attractive appearance is 5%. If we look at people in a relationship, does the chance of attractive appearance decrease when liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In fact, the probability of attractive appearance is higher for those who like spicy food and are in a relationship (5%) compared to those who do not like spicy food and are in a relationship (7%). This suggests that the positive effect of liking spicy food on relationship status may counteract the negative effect of not having an attractive appearance, leading to a higher probability of being in a relationship for those who like spicy food.||",
