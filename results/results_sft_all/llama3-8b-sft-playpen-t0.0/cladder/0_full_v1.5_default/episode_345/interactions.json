The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on skin. Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 4%. The probability of no tanning salon treatment and tanned skin is 7%. The probability of tanning salon treatment and tanned skin is 3%. Is the chance of tanned skin larger when observing tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
