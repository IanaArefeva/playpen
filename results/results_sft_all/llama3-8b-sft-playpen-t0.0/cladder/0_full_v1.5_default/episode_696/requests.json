Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 56%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 49%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that being male directly decreases the likelihood of admission acceptance by 7%. The counterfactual question is whether it would be more likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male. Since the direct effect of being male is a reduction in the probability of admission acceptance, it is not more likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male.<|eot_id|>",
