The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes sufficient vitamin C, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes scurvy. Would the patient recovers from scurvy if citrus intake instead of absence of citrus?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since citrus directly affects vitamin C, and vitamin C directly affects scurvy, we can conclude that citrus is a cause of scurvy. If citrus is present, it will lead to an increase in vitamin C, which in turn will lead to scurvy. If citrus is absent, it will lead to a decrease in vitamin C, which in turn will lead to a reduction in scurvy. In this case, the absence of citrus is the cause of scurvy, not the citrus itself.||",
