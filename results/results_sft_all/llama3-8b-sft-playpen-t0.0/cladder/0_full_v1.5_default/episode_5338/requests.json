Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. For hospitalized individuals, the correlation between drinking coffee and broken bones is -0.25. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does it mean that drinking coffee does not affect broken bones?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The negative correlation could be a result of hospitalization being a common cause for both coffee consumption and broken bones, rather than a direct causal relationship between the two. In other words, hospitalization could lead to both a higher likelihood of coffee consumption and a higher likelihood of broken bones, which would result in a negative correlation between the two variables.<|eot_id|>",
