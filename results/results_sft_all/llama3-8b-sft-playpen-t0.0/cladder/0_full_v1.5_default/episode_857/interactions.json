The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 34%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 37%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 68%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 65%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 4%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 9%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 79%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 56%. The overall probability of confounder active is 47%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of intelligent child is higher for children with intelligent parents and with both high and low parental social status compared to children with unintelligent parents and with both high and low parental social status. This suggests that there is an additional direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence that is not accounted for by parents' social status.||",
