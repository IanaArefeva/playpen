The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how obesity correlates with lifespan case by case according to diabetes. Method 2: We look directly at how obesity correlates with lifespan in general. To understand how obesity affects lifespan, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the effect of obesity on lifespan is fully mediated by its effect on diabetes. In other words, the relationship between obesity and lifespan is entirely dependent on the intervening variable of diabetes. If we look at the relationship between obesity and lifespan in general (Method 2), we would be missing the crucial role of diabetes in this chain of causality. In contrast, by looking at how obesity correlates with lifespan case by case according to diabetes (Method 1), we can account for the intervening variable and more accurately estimate the effect of obesity on lifespan.||",
