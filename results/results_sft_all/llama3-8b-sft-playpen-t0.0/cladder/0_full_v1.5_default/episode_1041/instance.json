  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 91%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 82%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 26%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 70%. Will increased supply increase the chance of increased price?",
