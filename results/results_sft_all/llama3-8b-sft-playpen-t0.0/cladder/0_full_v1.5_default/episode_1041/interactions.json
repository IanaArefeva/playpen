The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 91%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 82%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 26%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 70%. Will increased supply increase the chance of increased price?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The given probabilities do not directly imply that an increase in supply will lead to an increase in price. In fact, the opposite is likely to be true: if demand is unobserved and supply is directly related to yield per acre, then an increase in yield per acre (leading to an increase in supply) would likely lead to a decrease in price, not an increase.||",
