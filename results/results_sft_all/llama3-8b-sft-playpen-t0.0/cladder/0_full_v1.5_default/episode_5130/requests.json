The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 59%. For people without a college degree, the probability of large feet is 76%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of large feet is 10%. Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of large feet is 10% for people with a college degree or higher, and 76% for those without a college degree. Since the probability of large feet is higher for those without a college degree than for those with one, and the overall probability of college degree or higher is 59%, we can conclude that large feet are not more likely than small feet overall.<|eot_id|>",
