Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 28%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For people with smoking genes, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had a nonsmoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The additional direct relationship between the unobserved pollution and both the gene and lung cancer further solidifies this higher risk. Since the person already has a smoking gene, the additional condition of having a nonsmoking gene does not reduce the risk of lung cancer; rather, it remains at the higher level associated with the smoking gene (40%).<|eot_id|>",
