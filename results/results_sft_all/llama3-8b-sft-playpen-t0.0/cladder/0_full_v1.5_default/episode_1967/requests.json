Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 88%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 12%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 26%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that 0.88 * 0.26 = 0.2288 of the population has a college degree and a high salary. The probability of having a college degree and a high salary is less than the probability of having a college degree (0.88), which in turn is less than the probability of having a high salary (0.26). This suggests that the relationship between college degree and high salary is not as strong as the relationship between college degree and the absence of a high salary. The probability of having a college degree and a high salary is also less than the probability of having a college degree and a low salary (0.88 - 0.26 = 0.62), which further supports the idea that high salary is not more likely than low salary overall.<|eot_id|>",
