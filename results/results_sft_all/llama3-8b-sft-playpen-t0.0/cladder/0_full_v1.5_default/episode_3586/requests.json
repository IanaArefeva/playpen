Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 58%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 69%. For people who have a brother, would it be more likely to see smallpox survival if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the presence of a brother directly affects the likelihood of smallpox survival, but it does not imply that the absence of a brother would lead to a higher probability of smallpox survival. In fact, the absence of a brother is associated with a lower probability of smallpox survival (58%).<|eot_id|>",
