The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 56%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 70%. For people who have a brother, would it be less likely to see high salary if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that having a brother is a cause of higher skill and higher salary. If we condition on having a brother, we are still looking at a person whose skill is higher than it would be without a brother, and whose salary is higher than it would be without a brother. The probability of high salary given having a brother is 70%, which is higher than the 56% probability of high salary for those without a brother. This suggests that having a brother still exerts a positive effect on salary, and that the relationship between having a brother and high salary is not inverted.<|eot_id|>",
