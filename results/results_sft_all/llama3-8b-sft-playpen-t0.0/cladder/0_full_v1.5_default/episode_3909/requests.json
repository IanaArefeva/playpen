The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how having visited England correlates with salary in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to occupation. To understand how having visited England affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since skill is unobserved, we must account for its potential confounding effect on the relationship between having visited England and salary. Method 1 directly looks at the general correlation between having visited England and salary, which could be subject to confounding by skill. In contrast, Method 2 controls for occupation, which is directly affected by both having visited England and skill. This control for occupation can help mitigate the confounding effect of skill, providing a more accurate picture of the direct relationship between having visited England and salary.<|eot_id|>",
