Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 32%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 45%. Will alarm set by husband decrease the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm ringing is higher when the husband sets the alarm (45%) than when he doesn't (32%). This indicates that setting the alarm by the husband is associated with a higher likelihood of the alarm ringing, rather than a lower likelihood.<|eot_id|>",
