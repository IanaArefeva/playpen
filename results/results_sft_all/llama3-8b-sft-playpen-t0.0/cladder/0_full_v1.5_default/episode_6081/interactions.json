The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. We know that being able to swim causes lack of studying. being able to swim or studying hard causes high exam score. Would the student has a low exam score if being able to swim instead of not being able to swim?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between being able to swim and studying habits is that being able to swim causes a lack of studying. Since being able to swim leads to a high exam score, and a high exam score is not typically associated with a lack of studying, we can conclude that the exam score is not directly determined by the studying habits in this case.
