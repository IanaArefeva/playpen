Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 10%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 41%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the person in question already has a higher probability of lung cancer (41%) by virtue of already being a jazz listener, removing the direct effect of jazz on lung cancer would not reduce the person's probability of lung cancer below the 10% associated with not being a jazz listener.<|eot_id|>",
