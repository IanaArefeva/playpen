Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. We know that old age causes low hospital bill. old age or high hospital bill causes recovery. We observed the patient is young.

Since we have a condition that old age causes a high hospital bill, and we also have a condition that old age or a high hospital bill lead to recovery, we can conclude that a high hospital bill is necessary for recovery. In this case, the patient is young, which we already know doesn't lead to a high hospital bill. If we consider the possibility of a high hospital bill instead of a low hospital bill, we can conclude that the patient would still not recover, as the direct relationship between hospital costs and recovery still holds.<|eot_id|>",
