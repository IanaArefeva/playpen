The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of having visited England is 8%. The probability of not having visited England and the prisoner's death is 29%. The probability of having visited England and the prisoner's death is 7%. Is the chance of the prisoner's death smaller when observing having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The given probabilities (8% for England visit, 29% for no England visit and the prisoner's death, and 7% for England visit and the prisoner's death) do not support the conclusion that the chance of the prisoner's death is smaller when England is visited.||",
