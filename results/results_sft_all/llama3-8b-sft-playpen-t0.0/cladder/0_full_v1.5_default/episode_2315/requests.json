The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 56%. For normal weight people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 82%. For obese people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 56%. For obese people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 81%. For normal weight people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 58%. For normal weight people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 72%. For obese people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 29%. For obese people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 20%. The overall probability of smoker is 86%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would obesity positively affect lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of long lifespan is the same for both normal weight and obese people in the absence of diabetes (56%). This suggests that, in the absence of diabetes, the direct effect of obesity on lifespan is neutral. The higher probability of long lifespan in the presence of diabetes for both normal weight and obese people (82% and 81%, respectively) further blurs the direct relationship between obesity and lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
