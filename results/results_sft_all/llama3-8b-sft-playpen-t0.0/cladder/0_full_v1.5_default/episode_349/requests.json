Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 9%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 36%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 88%. Is tanned skin less likely than pale skin overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of tanned skin is 9% for those who use tanning salon treatments and 36% for those who do not. Since the probability of tanning salon treatment is 9%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction to get the overall probability of tanned skin: (9% * 88%) + (91% * 36%) = 7.92% + 32.76% = 40.68%. In comparison, the probability of pale skin is 1 - 40.68% = 59.32%.<|eot_id|>",
