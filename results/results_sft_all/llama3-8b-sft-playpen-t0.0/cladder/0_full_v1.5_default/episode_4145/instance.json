  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and rainfall. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 61%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of high rainfall is 77%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of high rainfall is 46%. Is high rainfall less likely than low rainfall overall?",
