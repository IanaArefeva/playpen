Treatment has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of receives treatment is 42%. The probability of receives no treatment and being allergic to peanuts is 21%. The probability of receives treatment and being allergic to peanuts is 22%. Is the chance of being allergic to peanuts smaller when observing receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the chance of being allergic to peanuts is larger when the person is not treated, rather than when they are.<|eot_id|>",
