The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 76%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 37%. Will intelligent parents increase the chance of intelligent child?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, parents' social status is a more reliable indicator of child's intelligence than parents' intelligence. The probability of an intelligent child given intelligent parents is lower than the probability of an intelligent child given parents of lower social status, which further dilutes the positive effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
