The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 28%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 84%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 46%. Is cholera contraction more likely than cholera prevention overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the overall probability of liking spicy food is 28%, we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of cholera contraction. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event E is the sum of the products of the probability of E given each possible cause C and the probability of C. In this case, the event E is cholera contraction, and the two possible causes C are \"like spicy food\" and \"not like spicy food\". The probability of E given C is the probability of E in the subpopulation where C is true. The probability of C is the probability of C in the entire population. The law of total probability can be formalized as follows: P(E) = P(E|C1)P(C1) + P(E|C2)P(C2), where E is the event of interest, C1 and C2 are the two possible causes, and P(E|C1) and P(E|C2) are the probabilities of E given C1 and C2, respectively. In this case, E is the event of cholera contraction, C1 is the event of \"like spicy food\", and C2 is the event of \"not like spicy food\". The probability of E given C1 is 46%, and the probability of E",
