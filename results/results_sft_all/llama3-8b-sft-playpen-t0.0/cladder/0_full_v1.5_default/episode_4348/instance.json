  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 81%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 53%. For infants with smoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 92%. For infants with smoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 51%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 53%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 84%. For infants with smoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 13%. For infants with smoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 41%. The overall probability of good health is 48%. Does maternal smoking status positively affect freckles through infant's birth weight?",
  "target": "yes"
