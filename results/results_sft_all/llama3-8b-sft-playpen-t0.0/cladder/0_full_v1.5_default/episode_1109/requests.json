Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 57%. The probability of low hospital bill and recovery is 25%. The probability of high hospital bill and recovery is 20%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing high hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high hospital bill is 57%, and the probability of high hospital bill and recovery is 20%. This does not imply that the chance of recovery is larger when observing a high hospital bill. In fact, the probability of high hospital bill and recovery is lower than the probability of high hospital bill (57%) and the probability of recovery in the absence of a high hospital bill (25% is the probability of both a low hospital bill and a positive recovery, and we do not have direct information on the probability of a positive recovery in the absence of a high hospital bill, but we can conclude that the probability of a positive recovery in the absence of a high hospital bill is higher than 20% since the probability of a positive recovery is higher than 25% and the probability of a high hospital bill is 57%).<|eot_id|>",
