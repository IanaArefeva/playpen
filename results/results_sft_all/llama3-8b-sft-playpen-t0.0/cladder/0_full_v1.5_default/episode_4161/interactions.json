The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 21%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 35%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 85%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 99%. The overall probability of male gender is 44%. For patients who have a brother, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the overall probability of male gender is 44%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction to get the overall probability of recovery for patients who have a brother: (0.44 * 0.99) + (0.56 * 0.35) = 0.4484 + 0.1964 = 0.6448. In comparison, the probability of recovery for patients who do not have a brother is 21% if they are not male and 85% if they are male, which we can also weight by the probability of male gender: (0.44 * 0.85) + (0.56 * 0.21) = 0.3774 + 0.1176 = 0.495. Since 0.6448 is greater than 0.495, it is more likely to see recovery if the patient has a brother.||",
