The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of having visited England is 42%. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 33%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 70%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In contrast, the probability of high salary among those who have not visited England is 33%. This gap in probability between the two groups—37 percentage points—sufficiently counterbalances the higher base probability of not having visited England (58%) to ensure that the overall probability of high salary is higher than that of low salary.<|eot_id|>",
