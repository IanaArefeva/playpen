The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 38%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 87%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 2%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 52%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 41%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 92%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking positively affect college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In fact, for both lazy and hard-working subgroups, the probability of college admission is lower for smokers than for nonsmokers. For lazy subgroups, the probability of college admission is 2% for smokers compared to 38% for nonsmokers. For hard-working subgroups, the probability of college admission is 52% for smokers compared to 87% for nonsmokers. This pattern of lower college admission probabilities for smokers than for nonsmokers across both subgroups suggests that, in this world, smoking has a negative direct effect on college admission.||",
