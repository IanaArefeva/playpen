The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how ability to speak english correlates with lifespan in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to diabetes. To understand how ability to speak english affects lifespan, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the absence of any direct relationship between English ability and diabetes, we must consider the possibility that the observed relationship between English ability and lifespan is spurious, being instead a result of the direct relationship between English ability and diabetes, which in turn affects lifespan. Method 1 does not control for this potential spuriousness, as it looks at the general relationship between English ability and lifespan without accounting for the intervening variable of diabetes. In contrast, Method 2 controls for the intervening variable of diabetes by examining the relationship between English ability and lifespan on a case-by-case basis, which can help to rule out spuriousness and provide a more accurate estimate of the direct relationship between English ability and lifespan.||",
