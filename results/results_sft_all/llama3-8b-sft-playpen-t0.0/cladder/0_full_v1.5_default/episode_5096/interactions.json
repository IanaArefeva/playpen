Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 67%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 80%. Does having a brother negatively affect salary through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
