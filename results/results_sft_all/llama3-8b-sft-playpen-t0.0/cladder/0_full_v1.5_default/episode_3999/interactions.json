The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 46%. For children who do not like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 41%. For children who like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 66%. Is intelligent child less likely than unintelligent child overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between parents' social status and child's intelligence is also positive, as higher social status parents are likely to have more intelligent children. The direct relationship between liking spicy food and parents' social status is also positive, as parents who like spicy food are likely to have higher social status. The unobserved \"Other unobserved factors\" has a direct effect on both parents' social status and child's intelligence, but its sign is not specified. Since the direct relationships between the variables are mostly positive, and the overall probability of liking spicy food is 46%, it is likely that the positive direct relationships will dominate the overall relationship between intelligent child and unobserved \"Other unobserved factors\".||",
