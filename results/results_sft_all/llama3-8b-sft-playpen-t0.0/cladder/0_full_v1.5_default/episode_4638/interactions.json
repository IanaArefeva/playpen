The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 3%. The probability of not drinking coffee and dark room is 82%. The probability of drinking coffee and dark room is 1%. Is the chance of dark room smaller when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
