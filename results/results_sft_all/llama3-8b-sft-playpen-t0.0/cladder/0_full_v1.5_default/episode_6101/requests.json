The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender and in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes brown eyes. We observed the resident is in-state. Would the applicant has blue eyes if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If the applicant is not male, this chain of cause and effect is disrupted, and we must consider the direct relationship between in-state residency and brown eyes. Since in-state residency is unobserved, we can conclude that the direct relationship between in-state residency and brown eyes is not established. In this case, the only remaining direct relationship is between male gender and brown eyes, which still holds. Therefore, the applicant would still have brown eyes, not blue eyes.<|eot_id|>",
