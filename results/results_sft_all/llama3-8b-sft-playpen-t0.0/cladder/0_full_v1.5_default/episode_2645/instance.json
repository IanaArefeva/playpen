Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 79%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 40%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. The overall probability of smoking is 45%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?",
