The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 79%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 40%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. The overall probability of smoking is 45%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than that among nonsmokers in both the no tar and high tar scenarios. This suggests that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is more complex than a direct cause-and-effect relationship. The higher probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers in the no tar and high tar scenarios further blurs the direct link between smoking and lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
