The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. We know that high poverty and global water company causes clean water. high poverty or clean water causes cholera contraction. We observed the person is served by a global water company and the region has high poverty. Would the person avoids cholera if polluted water instead of clean water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Additionally, we are given that high poverty and the person's service by a global water company both lead to clean water. Since the person is served by a global water company, we can conclude that they have clean water. The direct effect of water quality on cholera means that clean water will reduce the risk of cholera. The person's region has high poverty, which we know leads to clean water, further solidifying the likelihood of clean water for this person. Finally, we are told that clean water leads to a lower risk of cholera. Based on this chain of cause and effect, we can conclude that the person will likely avoid cholera if they have clean water, which we have established is the case.||",
