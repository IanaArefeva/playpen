The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on full moon and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on full moon. Full moon has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 51%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 42%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of full moon is 73%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of full moon is 45%. Will full moon increase the chance of increased price?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of full moon is higher for farms with reduced yield per acre (73%) than for those with increased yield per acre (45%). This difference in probability of full moon between the two groups of farm yield per acre does not directly translate to a difference in the probability of price increase, as the relationship between full moon and price is mediated by demand, which is unobserved.||",
