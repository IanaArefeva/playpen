The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 24%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 41%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 87%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 97%. The overall probability of male gender is 42%. Will having a brother increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that having a brother is associated with a higher chance of recovery.<|eot_id|>",
