The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 59%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 75%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 99%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, having a college degree is almost a guarantee of a high salary. The probability of high salary for those without a college degree is still 75%, which is higher than the probability of high salary for those with a college degree in the general population (59% of the general population has a college degree, and 99% of those with a college degree have a high salary, so the overall probability of high salary is still higher than the probability of college degree). This suggests that the direct effect of college degree on high salary is more significant than the direct effect of college degree on the probability of having a college degree.<|eot_id|>",
