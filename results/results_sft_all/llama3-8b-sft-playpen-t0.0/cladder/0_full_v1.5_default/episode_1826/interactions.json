The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Vaccination status has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of vaccination is 2%. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 43%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 54%. Is smallpox survival more likely than smallpox death overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between smallpox and smallpox survival is also positive, as those who contract smallpox are more likely to survive than those who do not. The direct relationship between vaccination and smallpox is negative, as those who are vaccinated are less likely to contract smallpox than those who are not.
