The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 22%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of dark room is 48%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of dark room is 78%. Is dark room more likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of the candle on room is that it makes the room more likely to be bright. The probability of dark room is higher for people who like spicy food (78%) than for those who do not like spicy food (48%). Since the probability of liking spicy food is 22%, we can conclude that the overall probability of dark room is lower than that of bright room.<|eot_id|>",
