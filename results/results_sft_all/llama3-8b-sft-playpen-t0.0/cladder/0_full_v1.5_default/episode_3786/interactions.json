The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who cannot swim, the probability of high exam score is 26%. For students who can swim, the probability of high exam score is 72%. For students who can swim, would it be more likely to see high exam score if the student could swim?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the ability to swim directly affects exam score. The studying habits of students who can and cannot swim are not directly related to their ability to swim, and the exam score is only directly related to the studying habits of students who can and cannot swim. In this case, the studying habits of students who can and cannot swim are the same, and the exam score is only directly related to the studying habits of students who can and cannot swim. Since the exam score is only directly related to the studying habits of students who can and cannot swim, and the studying habits of students who can and cannot swim are the same, the exam score is not more likely to be high for students who can swim than for students who cannot swim.||",
