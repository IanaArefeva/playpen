The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 36%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 56%. For people who have a brother, would it be less likely to see smallpox survival if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional information that having a brother directly affects smallpox survival and that this relationship is separate from the relationship between having a brother and vaccination reaction, which also affects smallpox survival, means that the probability of smallpox survival for someone who has a brother is higher than for someone who does not have a brother, and this higher probability is not dependent on the person's vaccination reaction.||",
