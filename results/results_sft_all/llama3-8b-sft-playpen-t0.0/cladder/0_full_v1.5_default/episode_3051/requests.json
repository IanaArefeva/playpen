Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives treatment. large kidney stone or receives treatment causes recovery.

Since the patient has a small kidney stone, they would not typically require treatment. The direct relationship between treatment and recovery is that treatment leads to recovery. If the patient doesn't have a large kidney stone and doesn't require treatment, they would still not have a direct cause for not recovering. The condition of having a small kidney stone does not imply a direct cause for not recovering, and the absence of a large kidney stone does not imply a direct cause for not recovering. The direct relationship between large kidney stone and not recovering is that large kidney stone size leads to not recovering, and the direct relationship between large kidney stone and not having a small kidney stone is that large kidney stone size leads to not having a small kidney stone. The direct relationship between large kidney stone and not having a small kidney stone is that large kidney stone size leads to not having a small kidney stone, and the direct relationship between large kidney stone and not having a small kidney stone is that large kidney stone size leads to not having a small kidney stone.<|eot_id|>",
