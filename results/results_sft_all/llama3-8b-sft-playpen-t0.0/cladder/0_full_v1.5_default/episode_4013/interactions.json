The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 36%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 74%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 46%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 69%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 78%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 21%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect lactose intolerance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between smoking and being hard-working is also a key factor. In the given world, the probability of being hard-working is lower for smokers (21%) than for nonsmokers (78%). Since being hard-working is associated with a higher probability of being lactose intolerant (74% for nonsmokers and 69% for smokers), the lower probability of being hard-working among smokers actually counteracts the direct positive relationship between smoking and lactose intolerance. This counteraction ultimately leads to a negative overall effect of smoking on the probability of being lactose intolerant.||",
