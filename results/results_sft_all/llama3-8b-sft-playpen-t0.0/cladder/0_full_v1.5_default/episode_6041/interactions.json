Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. We know that having a sister causes high blood pressure. having a sister and high blood pressure causes healthy heart.

If we consider the chain of cause and effect, we see that having a sister leads to high blood pressure, which in turn leads to a heart condition.
