The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who cannot swim, the probability of high exam score is 34%. For students who can swim, the probability of high exam score is 68%. Will being able to swim increase the chance of high exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a high exam score is higher for students who can swim (68%) than for those who can't (34%), but this difference is not large enough to conclude that being able to swim directly affects exam score. The primary driver of exam score appears to be studying habits, which is not directly related to the ability to swim.||",
