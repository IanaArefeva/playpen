The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 37%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 83%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 30%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 78%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 14%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 44%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 61%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 87%. The overall probability of high pollution is 57%. Does gene negatively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The gene affects the likelihood of smoking, which in turn affects the likelihood of lung cancer. The direct relationship between the gene and lung cancer is not negative; in fact, the probability of lung cancer is higher for those with the smoking gene than for those without it, across all smoking statuses. The gene's effect on lung cancer is positive through the intermediate variable of smoking.<|eot_id|>",
