Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 77%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin death is 43%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin death is 50%. Is penguin death less likely than penguin lives overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of taking the stairs is 23% (100% - 77%) and the probability of taking the elevator is 77%, we can weight the probabilities of penguin death by the corresponding probabilities of taking the stairs and the elevator. The overall probability of penguin death is then (0.23 * 0.43) + (0.77 * 0.50) = 0.0991 + 0.3855 = 0.4846. The probability of penguin lives is 1 - 0.4846 = 0.5154. Since 0.4846 is less than 0.5154, penguin death is less likely than penguin lives overall.<|eot_id|>",
