The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 6%. The probability of high school degree or lower and high salary is 25%. The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 3%. Is the chance of high salary smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of college degree or higher is 6%, and the probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 3%. This means that only a fraction of those with a college degree or higher also have a high salary. In fact, the probability of college degree or higher and high salary is less than the probability of college degree or higher (6% vs 3%). This suggests that having a college degree or higher does not guarantee a high salary, and that there might be other intervening factors that reduce the likelihood of high salary among those with a college degree or higher.||",
