Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of receives treatment is 64%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 80%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 51%. Is thick lips more likely than thin lips overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of not receiving treatment is 36%, we can calculate the overall probability of thick lips as follows: (0.64 * 0.36) + (0.80 * 0.64) = 0.23 + 0.51 = 0.74. The probability of thick lips is higher than the probability of thin lips (1 - 0.74 = 0.26), so thick lips are more likely than thin lips overall.<|eot_id|>",
