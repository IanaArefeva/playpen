For people who have a brother and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 52%. For people who have a brother and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 28%. The overall probability of high pollution is 49%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would having a brother negatively affect lung cancer?",
