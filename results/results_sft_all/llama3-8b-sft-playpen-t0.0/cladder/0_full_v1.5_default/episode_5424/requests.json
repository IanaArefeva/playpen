Effort has a direct effect on freckles. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 91%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 65%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see freckles if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of effort on freckles is an increase in the probability of freckles. Since the student is a smoker, the direct effect of smoking on freckles already reduces the probability of freckles to 65%. If the student had been a nonsmoker, the direct effect of effort on freckles would still increase the probability of freckles, but it would not counteract the reduction in the probability of freckles caused by the direct effect of smoking. Therefore, it would not be more likely to see freckles if the student had been a nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
