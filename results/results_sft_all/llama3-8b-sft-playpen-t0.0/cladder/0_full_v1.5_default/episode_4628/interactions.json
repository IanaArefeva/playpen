The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 17%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 93%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 62%. Is dark room less likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of drinking coffee is 17%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction: (0.17 * 0.62) + (0.83 * 0.93) = 0.1064 + 0.7731 = 0.8795. The probability of bright room is then 1 - 0.8795 = 0.1205. Since 0.8795 is greater than 0.1205, dark room is more likely than bright room overall.||",
