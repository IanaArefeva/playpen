Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 22%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 50%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 22%. Is normal infant birth weight less likely than low infant birth weight overall?",
