The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. We know that blowing out the candle or candle with wax causes dark room. We observed the candle is out of wax. Would the room is dark if not blowing out the candle instead of blowing out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
