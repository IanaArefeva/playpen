The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that intelligent parents or confounder active causes high parental social status. intelligent parents and confounder active and high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder active. Would the child is intelligent if unintelligent parents instead of intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that intelligent parents lead to high social status and that this chain of cause and effect ultimately leads to an intelligent child, we can conclude that the chain of cause and effect is complete and that the child will be intelligent if the parents are intelligent. If we consider the case where the parents are unintelligent, we still have the direct effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence, and we already know that the confounder active is present, which means that the chain of cause and effect is still complete and that the child will be intelligent.||",
