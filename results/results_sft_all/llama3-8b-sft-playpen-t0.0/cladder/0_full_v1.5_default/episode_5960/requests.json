Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes not having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England and director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired.

If the CEO decides to fire the employee, then the director will sign the termination letter, and the employee will be fired. If the CEO instead decides to retain the employee, then the director will not sign the termination letter, and the employee will not be fired. The visit to England does not directly cause the event of the employee being fired; rather, it is the actions of the CEO and the director that lead to this outcome. Since we are told that the CEO has decided to retain the employee, we can conclude that the employee will not be fired, and the visit to England will not lead to the event of the employee being fired.<|eot_id|>",
