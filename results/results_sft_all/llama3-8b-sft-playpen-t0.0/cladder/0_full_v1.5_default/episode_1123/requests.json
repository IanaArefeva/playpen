The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 6%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 19%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 80%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 93%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 50%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\n\nLet's first consider the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone who does not receive treatment. In this case, the probability of recovery is 6%. Now, if we consider the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone who does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 19%. This means that treatment does not increase the chance of recovery for a patient with a small kidney stone, as the probability of recovery is lower in the counterfactual where the patient does not receive treatment (6%) than in the counterfactual where the patient does receive treatment (19%).\n\nNext, we consider the counterfactual of a patient with a large kidney stone who does not receive treatment. In this case, the probability of recovery is 80%. Now, if we consider the counterfactual of a patient with a large kidney stone who does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 93%. This means that treatment does increase the chance of recovery for a patient with a large kidney stone, as the probability of recovery is higher in the counterfactual where the patient does not receive treatment (80%) than in the counterfactual where the patient does receive treatment (93%).\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks whether",
