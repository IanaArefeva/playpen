The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 79%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 39%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
