The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 43%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 61%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 34%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between college degree and high salary is negative (34% vs 61%). The unobserved confounder has a direct positive relationship with both college degree and high salary. The overall probability of high salary is lower than that of low salary, which is 57% (100% - 43% - 34%).<|eot_id|>",
