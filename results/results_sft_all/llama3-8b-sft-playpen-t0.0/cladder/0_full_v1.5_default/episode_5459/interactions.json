The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 42%. For people who do not play card games and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 63%. For people who play card games and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 63%. For people who play card games and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 86%. For people who do not play card games and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 87%. For people who do not play card games and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 59%. For people who play card games and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 57%. For people who play card games and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 28%. The overall probability of smoker is 81%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would playing card games negatively affect lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
