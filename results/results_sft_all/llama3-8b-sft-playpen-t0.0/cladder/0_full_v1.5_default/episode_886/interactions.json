The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 47%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 11%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 71%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 40%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 41%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 57%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 89%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 82%. The overall probability of confounder active is 56%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is not isolated from the confounding variable. The probability of intelligent child is higher when parents have both high intelligence and high social status than when parents have only high intelligence and low social status, which suggests that parents' social status acts as a confounding variable. The positive relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence is not fully accounted for by parents' social status, as the probability of intelligent child is still higher when parents have both high intelligence and high social status than when parents have only high intelligence and low social status.||",
