Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 12%. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 90%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of not listening to jazz is 88% (100% - 12%), we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of lung cancer. The law of total probability states that the overall probability of an event is the sum of the products of the probability of each cause and the probability of the event given that cause. In this case, the probability of lung cancer is the sum of the products of the probability of not listening to jazz and the probability of lung cancer given that condition, and the probability of listening to jazz and the probability of lung cancer given that condition. The law of total probability can be represented as: P(Lung Cancer) = P(Not Jazz) * P(Lung Cancer|Not Jazz) + P(Jazz) * P(Lung Cancer|Jazz) = 0.88 * 0.52 + 0.12 * 0.90 = 0.4592 + 0.108 = 0.5672. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.5672 = 0.4328. Since 0.5672 is greater than 0.4328, lung cancer is more likely than absence of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
