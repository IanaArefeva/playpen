The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 88%. The probability of not having a sister and high infant mortality is 10%. The probability of having a sister and high infant mortality is 56%. Is the chance of high infant mortality larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of having a sister and high infant mortality is 56%, which is higher than the probability of not having a sister and high infant mortality (10%).\n2. The probability of having a sister is 88%, which is higher than the probability of not having a sister (12%).\n3. The direct effect of having a sister on infant's birth weight and infant mortality is not clear from the given information, and the direct effect of health condition on both birth weight and infant mortality is also not clear.\n4. The direct effect of birth weight on infant mortality is clear, but this does not directly imply that having a sister would lead to higher infant mortality.\n5. The correct approach to this question involves using the law of total probability and Bayes' rule to condition on the observed event (having a sister) and then re-estimate the probability of high infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
