Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 40%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 58%. For people who play card games, would it be more likely to see long lifespan if the person did not play card games?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between not playing card games and long lifespan is also positive, with a 40% probability of long lifespan for those who do not play card games. The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is negative, with a lower probability of long lifespan associated with diabetes. Since the direct relationship between card game play and long lifespan is positive, and the direct relationship between not playing card games and long lifespan is also positive, it is not more likely to see long lifespan if the person did not play card games.<|eot_id|>",
