The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 81%. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 70%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 54%. Is high infant mortality less likely than low infant mortality overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 81% of the time, an infant will have a sister, and 54% of the time, that will lead to high infant mortality. The remaining 19% of the time, the infant will not have a sister, and in that case, the probability of high infant mortality is 70%. To find the overall probability of high infant mortality, we need to consider both scenarios: having a sister and not having a sister. The overall probability of high infant mortality is the weighted average of the two scenarios, where the weights are the probabilities of each scenario. In this case, the weight for the \"sister\" scenario is 0.81 (81% of the time) and the weight for the \"no sister\" scenario is 0.19 (19% of the time). The overall probability of high infant mortality is then: (0.81) * (0.54) + (0.19) * (0.70) = 0.4431 + 0.133 = 0.5761. Since 0.5761 is less than 0.5, we conclude that high infant mortality is less likely than low infant mortality overall.||",
