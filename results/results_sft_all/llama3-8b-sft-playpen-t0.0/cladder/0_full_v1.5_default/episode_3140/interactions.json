The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. We know that high poverty or global water company causes clean water. high poverty and clean water causes cholera contraction. We observed the person is served by a global water company and the region has high poverty. Would the person avoids cholera if clean water instead of polluted water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the person is in a region with high poverty, we can conclude that the water quality is likely to be bad. Additionally, we have the condition that high poverty and clean water cause cholera contraction, which further supports the idea that the person is at risk of contracting cholera. If we consider the possibility of clean water instead of polluted water, we must also consider the direct effect of water quality on cholera. In this case, the person's risk of contracting cholera would still be high, as the direct effect of water quality on cholera would likely counteract the positive effect of clean water.||",
