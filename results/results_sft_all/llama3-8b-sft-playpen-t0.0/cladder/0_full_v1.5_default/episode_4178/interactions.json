The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 6%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 26%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 78%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 98%. The overall probability of male gender is 47%. Will having a brother decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the male patient group, the probability of having a brother is 98% and the probability of recovery is 78%, which is higher than the 26% probability of recovery for male patients without a brother. In the female patient group, the probability of having a brother is 26% and the probability of recovery is 26%, which is higher than the 6% probability of recovery for female patients without a brother. This pattern of higher recovery probabilities associated with having a brother in both male and female patient groups suggests that having a brother is not a negative factor for recovery, and in fact, it appears to be a positive factor in this context.||",
