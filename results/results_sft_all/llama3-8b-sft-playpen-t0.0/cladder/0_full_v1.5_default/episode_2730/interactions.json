The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 81%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 17%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of being a smoker is 81%, and the probability of being a nonsmoker is 19%. The probability of lung cancer among smokers is 49%, and the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers is 17%. The overall probability of lung cancer is (0.81 * 0.49) + (0.19 * 0.17) = 0.3983 + 0.0323 = 0.4306. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.4306 = 0.5694. Since 0.5694 is greater than 0.4306, lung cancer is less likely than absence of lung cancer overall.||",
