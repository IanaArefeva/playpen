The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and rainfall. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of high rainfall is 40%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of high rainfall is 26%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 38%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 72%. Will increased supply increase the chance of high rainfall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since demand is unobserved, we can't conclude that demand is the direct cause of the relationship between yield per acre and supply. The direct relationship between yield per acre and supply is also not clear from the given information. The relationship between yield per acre and high rainfall is also not direct, as the probability of high rainfall is different for farms with reduced and increased yield per acre. The direct relationship between supply and high rainfall is also not clear from the given information. The only direct relationship we can conclude is that yield per acre has a direct effect on supply, and demand has a direct effect on both yield per acre and supply.||",
