The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that liking spicy food and confounder active causes high parental social status. liking spicy food and confounder active and high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder active. Would the child is intelligent if not liking spicy food instead of liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that the active confounder is present, we can conclude that the child's intelligence is not directly dependent on the parents' social status. Liking spicy food and the active confounder together lead to high parental social status, which in turn leads to the child's intelligence. If we remove the direct effect of liking spicy food on parents' social status, the chain of causality would still be active through the active confounder. The child's intelligence is not directly dependent on the parents' social status, so removing the direct effect of liking spicy food on parents' social status would not change the child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
