For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 65%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 51%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 70%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 14%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 60%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 28%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 68%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 12%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect admission status?",
