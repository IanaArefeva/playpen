The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 94%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 74%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 65%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 40%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 59%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 2%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would encouragement level negatively affect exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The exam score for students who are not encouraged is 94% for those who do not study hard and 74% for those who study hard, while the exam score for students who are encouraged is 65% for those who do not study hard and 40% for those who study hard. This positive direct relationship between encouragement and exam score supersedes any potential negative effects through the studying habit.<|eot_id|>",
