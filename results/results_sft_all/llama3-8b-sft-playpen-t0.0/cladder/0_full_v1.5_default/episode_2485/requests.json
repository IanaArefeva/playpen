The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 51%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 32%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 74%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of recovery is the sum of the two, which is 0.5 + 0.32 = 0.82. The probability of non-recovery is 1 - 0.82 = 0.18. Since 0.82 is less than 0.5, the probability of non-recovery is less than the probability of recovery, and the correct answer is No.<|eot_id|>",
