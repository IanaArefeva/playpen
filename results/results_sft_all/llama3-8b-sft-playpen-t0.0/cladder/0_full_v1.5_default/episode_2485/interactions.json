The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 51%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 32%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 74%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The overall probability of recovery is the sum of the two, which is 0.5 + 0.32 = 0.82. The probability of non-recovery is 1 - 0.82 = 0.18. Since 0.82 is less than 0.5, the probability of non-recovery is less than the probability of recovery, and the correct answer is No.||",
