The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 86%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 59%. Does eating citrus negatively affect curly hair through vitmain C?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having curly hair is lower for those eating citrus (59%) than for those not eating citrus (86%), which might lead one to conclude that citrus has a negative effect on curly hair. However, the direct relationship between citrus consumption and the probability of having curly hair is not through the intermediate variable of vitmain C. The correct intermediate relationship is that citrus consumption directly affects the level of vitmain C, and the level of vitmain C then affects the probability of having curly hair.||",
