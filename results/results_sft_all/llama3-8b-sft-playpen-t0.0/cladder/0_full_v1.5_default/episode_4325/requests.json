The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 49%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 61%. For infants with smoking mothers, would it be more likely to see freckles if the infant had a nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of freckles in infants with smoking mothers is higher than in those with nonsmoking mothers, which directly indicates that the direct relationship between maternal smoking and the probability of freckles is not subject to the birth weight of the infant.<|eot_id|>",
