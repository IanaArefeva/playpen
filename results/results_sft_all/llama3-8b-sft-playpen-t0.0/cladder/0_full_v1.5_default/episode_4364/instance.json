Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 62%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 93%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 44%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 96%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 25%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 70%. The overall probability of smoking is 51%. Does smoking negatively affect peanut allergy through tar deposit?",
