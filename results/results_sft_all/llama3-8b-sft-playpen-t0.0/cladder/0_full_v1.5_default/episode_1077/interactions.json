The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 4%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 26%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 77%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 98%. The overall probability of male gender is 56%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the direct effect of male gender on recovery is more significant than the direct effect of treatment on recovery. In particular, the 77% probability of recovery for male patients not receiving treatment is higher than the 26% probability of recovery for female patients who are receiving treatment. This indicates that the absence of male gender is a more significant barrier to recovery than the absence of treatment.||",
