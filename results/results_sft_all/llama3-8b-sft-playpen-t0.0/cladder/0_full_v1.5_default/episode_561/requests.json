The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. Method 1: We look directly at how education level correlates with salary in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to skill. To understand how education level affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this case, looking at the direct relationship between education and salary (Method 1) would likely lead to a spurious positive correlation, as higher education levels are associated with higher skills, which in turn lead to higher salaries. This would not reveal the direct effect of education on salary. In contrast, looking at the relationship between education and salary case by case according to skill (Method 2) would control for the intervening variable of skill, providing a more accurate measure of the direct effect of education on salary.<|eot_id|>",
