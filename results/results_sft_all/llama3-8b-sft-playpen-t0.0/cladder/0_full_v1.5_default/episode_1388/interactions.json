The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 51%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The intervening variable of tar deposit does not change the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer; rather, it acts as a bridge between the two. Since the person is already a smoker, the additional information about their past behavior as a nonsmoker does not reduce the likelihood of lung cancer, which remains higher than that of a typical nonsmoker.||",
