The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drug taken and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on drug taken. Drug taken has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active or assignment of drug treatment causes taking of all assigned drugs. confounder active or taking of all assigned drugs causes low cholesterol. We observed the patient is assigned the treatment and confounder inactive. Would the patient has low cholesterol if taking of all assigned drugs instead of not taking of any assigned drugs?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
