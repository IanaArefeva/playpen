Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 81%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 49%. Will obesity increase the chance of long lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of long lifespan for normal weight people is higher than for obese people, and the direct effect of diabetes on lifespan is negative, it is likely that the negative direct effect of obesity on diabetes will lead to a lower probability of long lifespan for obese people compared to normal weight people.<|eot_id|>",
