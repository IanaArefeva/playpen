The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 44%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 43%. Does having a brother negatively affect smallpox survival through getting smallpox and vaccination reaction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
