The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 1%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 35%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 84%. Is the forest on fire more likely than the forest not on fire overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of liking spicy food is 1%, the overall probability of the forest being on fire is still lower than the probability of the forest not being on fire (1% * 84% + 99% * 35% = 0.084 + 34.65 = 34.734, which is less than 65%).<|eot_id|>",
