The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 99%. For patients who have small kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 85%. For patients who have large kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 20%. For patients who have large kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 9%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 41%. For patients who speak english, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If we condition on the patient speaking English, we are looking at a subpopulation where the kidney stone size is not directly relevant to the probability of recovery, since the direct effect of kidney stone size on recovery is already accounted for by the language barrier. In this subpopulation, the probability of large kidney stone is still 41%, and the probability of recovery is 9% for large kidney stone and 85% for small kidney stone. Since the probability of large kidney stone is higher than the probability of small kidney stone in this subpopulation, the overall probability of recovery is lower than it would be if the patient did not speak English.<|eot_id|>",
