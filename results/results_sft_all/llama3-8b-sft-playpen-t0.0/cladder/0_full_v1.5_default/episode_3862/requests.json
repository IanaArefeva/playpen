Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of brown eyes is 75%. For individuals who are male, the probability of brown eyes is 82%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see brown eyes if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of brown eyes is higher for males (82%) than for non-males (75%). The additional condition that \"for males, the probability of brown eyes is 82%\" further solidifies this direct relationship. The question of whether it would be more likely to see brown eyes if the individual had not been male is not directly answerable with a \"Yes\" since the probability of brown eyes is already higher for males than for non-males.<|eot_id|>",
