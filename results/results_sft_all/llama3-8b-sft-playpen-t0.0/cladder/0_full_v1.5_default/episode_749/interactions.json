The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 83%. The probability of non-male gender and admission acceptance is 9%. The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 49%. Is the chance of admission acceptance smaller when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 49%, and the probability of male gender is 83%. This does not directly imply that male gender leads to a lower chance of admission acceptance. In fact, the higher probability of male gender (83%) compared to the probability of male gender and admission acceptance (49%) might indicate that male gender is not a barrier to admission. The direct relationship between male gender and admission acceptance is not established by the given information, and we should not conclude that male gender leads to a lower chance of admission acceptance.||",
