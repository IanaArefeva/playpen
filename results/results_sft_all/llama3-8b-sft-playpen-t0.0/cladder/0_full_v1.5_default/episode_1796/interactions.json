The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and penguin survival. Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are sad, the probability of penguin death is 72%. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are happy, the probability of penguin death is 38%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are sad, the probability of penguin death is 20%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are happy, the probability of penguin death is 0%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin happiness is 43%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin happiness is 89%. If we disregard the mediation effect through penguin mood, would my decision negatively affect penguin survival?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of penguin death is different for those who take the stairs and those who take the elevator, and the probability of penguin death is also different for those who are sad and those who are happy. If we consider the direct effect of my decision on penguin mood, we would need more information about the relationship between my decision and penguin mood. If we consider the direct effect of my decision on penguin survival, we would need more information about the relationship between my decision and penguin survival. Currently, we only have information about the relationship between my decision and penguin mood through the mediation of penguin mood on penguin survival.||",
