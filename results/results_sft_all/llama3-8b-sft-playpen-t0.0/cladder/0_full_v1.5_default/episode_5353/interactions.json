The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on relationship status. Appearance has a direct effect on relationship status. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 80%. For people who do not like spicy food and single people, the probability of attractive appearance is 93%. For people who do not like spicy food and in a relationship, the probability of attractive appearance is 73%. For people who like spicy food and single people, the probability of attractive appearance is 90%. For people who like spicy food and in a relationship, the probability of attractive appearance is 56%. If we look at people in a relationship, does the chance of attractive appearance increase when liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
