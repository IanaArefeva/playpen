The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 72%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 40%. For smokers, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 53%. Is being allergic to peanuts more likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher among smokers than among nonsmokers, and this difference is likely due to the intervening variable of tar deposit rather than any direct effect of smoke on the probability of being allergic to peanuts, we conclude that being allergic to peanuts is not more likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall.<|eot_id|>",
