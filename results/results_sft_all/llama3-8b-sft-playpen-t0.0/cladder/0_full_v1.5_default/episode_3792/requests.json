Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who cannot swim, the probability of high exam score is 30%. For students who can swim, the probability of high exam score is 64%. For students who can swim, would it be more likely to see high exam score if the student could swim?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the ability to swim directly affects exam score. The studying habits of students who can and cannot swim are not directly related to their ability to swim, and the exam score is only directly related to the studying habits of students who can and cannot swim. Since the exam score is not directly related to the ability to swim for students who can and cannot swim, we conclude that the ability to swim does not directly affect exam score for students who can swim.<|eot_id|>",
