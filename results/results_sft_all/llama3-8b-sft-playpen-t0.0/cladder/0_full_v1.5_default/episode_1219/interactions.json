The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 37%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 82%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 32%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 84%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of high tar deposit is higher than the probability of no tar deposit (84%  16%), we can conclude that the smoker is more likely to have high tar deposit than no tar deposit. With high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 82%, which is higher than the probability of lung cancer for a smoker with no tar deposit (49%). Therefore, it is more likely to see lung cancer in a smoker than in a nonsmoker, and the difference in lung cancer probability between a smoker and a nonsmoker is not due to the difference in the probability of high tar deposit.||",
