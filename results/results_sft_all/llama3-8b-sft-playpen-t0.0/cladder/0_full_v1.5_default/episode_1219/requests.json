Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 37%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 82%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 32%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 84%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high tar deposit for a smoker is 84%. Since the probability of high tar deposit is higher than the probability of no tar deposit (84% > 16%), we can conclude that the smoker is more likely to have high tar deposit than no tar deposit. With high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 82%, which is higher than the probability of lung cancer for a smoker with no tar deposit (49%). Therefore, it is more likely to see lung cancer in a smoker than in a nonsmoker, and the difference in lung cancer probability between a smoker and a nonsmoker is not due to the difference in the probability of high tar deposit.<|eot_id|>",
