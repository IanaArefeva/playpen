The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 43%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 81%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of black hair?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between education level and black hair is established through the intermediate variable \"skill\". Since college degree or higher directly affects skill, and skill in turn directly affects black hair, we can conclude that college degree or higher will increase the chance of black hair. The specific numbers (43% and 81%) further support this conclusion, as they indicate a clear increase in the probability of black hair among those with a college degree or higher compared to those without.<|eot_id|>",
