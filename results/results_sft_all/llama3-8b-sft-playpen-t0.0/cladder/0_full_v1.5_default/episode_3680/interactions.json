The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 43%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 81%.
