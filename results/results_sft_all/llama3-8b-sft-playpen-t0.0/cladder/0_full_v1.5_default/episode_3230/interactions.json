The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of having visited England is 30%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 18%. For people who have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 57%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only direct relationship we have is between having visited England and being fired, which is higher for those who have not visited England (18% vs 57%). Since the probability of having visited England is 30%, we can conclude that the overall probability of being fired is lower than the probability of not being fired.||",
