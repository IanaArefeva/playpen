The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 8%. The probability of non-male gender and admission acceptance is 47%. The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 3%. Is the chance of admission acceptance smaller when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between male gender and admission status is also not fully quantified. The direct relationship between department competitiveness and admission status is quantified, showing that higher department competitiveness is associated with lower admission probability. The given information does not directly link male gender to lower department competitiveness or lower admission probability. In the absence of explicit relationships between male gender and both department competitiveness and admission probability, we cannot conclude that male gender is associated with lower admission probability.<|eot_id|>",
