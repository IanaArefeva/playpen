The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 60%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 77%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 41%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of treatment is 60%, and the probability of non-treatment is 40%. To find the overall probability of recovery, we need to consider both scenarios: patients who do and do not receive treatment. The overall probability of recovery is the sum of the products of the probability of each scenario and the corresponding probability of recovery:\n(0.4 * 0.77) + (0.6 * 0.41) = 0.3084 + 0.246 = 0.5544\nThe overall probability of non-recovery is the sum of the products of the probability of each scenario and the corresponding probability of non-recovery:\n(0.4 * 0.23) + (0.6 * 0.59) = 0.092 + 0.354 = 0.446\nSince 0.5544  0.446, we conclude that, overall, recovery is more likely than non-recovery.||",
