Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 60%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 77%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 41%.

The probability of treatment is 60%, and the probability of non-treatment is 40%. To find the overall probability of recovery, we need to consider both scenarios: patients who do and do not receive treatment. The overall probability of recovery is the sum of the products of the probability of each scenario and the corresponding probability of recovery:\n(0.4 * 0.77) + (0.6 * 0.41) = 0.3084 + 0.246 = 0.5544\nThe overall probability of non-recovery is the sum of the products of the probability of each scenario and the corresponding probability of non-recovery:\n(0.4 * 0.23) + (0.6 * 0.59) = 0.092 + 0.354 = 0.446\nSince 0.5544 > 0.446, we conclude that, overall, recovery is more likely than non-recovery.<|eot_id|>",
