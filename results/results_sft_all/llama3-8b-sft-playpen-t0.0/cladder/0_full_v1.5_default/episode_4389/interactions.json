The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 50%. The probability of nonsmoking and being allergic to peanuts is 14%. The probability of smoking and being allergic to peanuts is 18%. Is the chance of being allergic to peanuts smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of smoking is 50%, and the probability of being both smoking and having a peanut allergy is 18%, we can conclude that the direct relationship between smoking and peanut allergy is not strong enough to offset the higher base rate of peanut allergy among nonsmokers. In fact, the higher base rate of peanut allergy among nonsmokers (14%) likely counteracts the direct relationship between smoking and peanut allergy, leading to a lower overall probability of being allergic to peanuts when observing smoking.||",
