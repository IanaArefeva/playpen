The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes vitamin C deficiency, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes scurvy. Would the patient recovers from scurvy if absence of citrus instead of citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the absence of citrus, we can conclude that the patient would have lower levels of vitamin C. Since we already established that citrus consumption directly affects vitamin C, we can conclude that the absence of citrus would lead to lower levels of vitamin C.
