The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drug taken and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on drug taken. Drug taken has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 57%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 54%. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 49%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 80%. Will taking of all assigned drugs decrease the chance of low cholesterol?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The higher probability of taking of all assigned drugs among those assigned the drug treatment (80%) compared to those not assigned the drug treatment (49%) further supports this. Since drug taken is a mediator, we need to examine the relationship between unobserved confounders and drug taken, as well as the relationship between drug taken and cholesterol level, to conclude whether taking of all assigned drugs would decrease the chance of low cholesterol.
