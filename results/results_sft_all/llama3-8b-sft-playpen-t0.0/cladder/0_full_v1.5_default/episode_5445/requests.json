Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 81%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 70%.

The only direct relationship that is established is between diabetes and lifespan, which shows that diabetes has a negative effect on lifespan. Since the probability of long lifespan is lower for people who play card games than for those who do not, it can be concluded that card game play has a negative effect on long lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
