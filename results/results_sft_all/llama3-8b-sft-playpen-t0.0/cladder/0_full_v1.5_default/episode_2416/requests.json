Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 55%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 30%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 72%.

The probability of treatment is 55%, which means that 55% of the population will have a 72% chance of recovery, and 45% will have a 30% chance of recovery. To find the overall probability of recovery, we need to consider both groups:\n- 55% of the population will have a 72% chance of recovery, so the contribution of this group to the overall probability of recovery is 0.55 * 0.72 = 0.396\n- 45% of the population will have a 30% chance of recovery, so the contribution of this group to the overall probability of recovery is 0.45 * 0.30 = 0.135\nThe total probability of recovery is the sum of these two contributions: 0.396 + 0.135 = 0.531\nThe probability of non-recovery is 1 - 0.531 = 0.469\nSince 0.531 > 0.469, we conclude that, overall, recovery is more likely than non-recovery.<|eot_id|>",
