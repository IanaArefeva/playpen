The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 69%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 54%. For people who have a sister, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If we condition on having a sister, the probability of lung cancer is already lower than for those without a sister. The additional step of removing the condition of having a sister would not further reduce the probability of lung cancer, as the direct relationship between having a sister and lower lung cancer risk is already accounted for.<|eot_id|>",
