The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between talent and being hard-working is -0.33. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does it mean that talent affects being hard-working?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between these two variables is likely spurious, as both are consequences of the same cause: being accepted to an elite institution. The negative correlation might be due to the fact that students who are more talented but less hard-working are still likely to get into an elite institution, while those who are both talented and hard-working are overrepresented in this group. This spurious relationship does not indicate a causal link between talent and being hard-working.||",
