The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 67%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 80%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be less likely to see high salary if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this world, having a college degree directly affects one's skill, and having higher skill directly affects one's likelihood of having a high salary. The probability of high salary for those without a college degree is already 67%, which is higher than the 50% we would expect by chance. This suggests that the skill acquired through education is still beneficial for those without a college degree, and they are still likely to have a high salary. The additional information that the probability of high salary for those with a college degree or higher is 80% does not change this conclusion, as it still does not imply that not having a college degree would reduce the likelihood of high salary for those with higher skill.||",
