The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 59%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 60%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of liking spicy food is 33%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of liking spicy food is 30%. Will liking spicy food increase the chance of cholera contraction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between water company and cholera is also positive, meaning that if you are served by a water company, you are more likely to contract cholera. The direct relationship between water company and liking spicy food is also positive, meaning that if you are served by a water company, you are more likely to like spicy food. Since the water company has a direct positive relationship with both cholera and liking spicy food, we can conclude that the positive relationship between liking spicy food and cholera is likely due to the water company rather than a direct relationship between the two.<|eot_id|>",
