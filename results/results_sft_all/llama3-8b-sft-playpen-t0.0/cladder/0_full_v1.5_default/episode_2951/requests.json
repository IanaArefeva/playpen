Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender and in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender or in-state residency or competitive department causes admission acceptance.

Since male gender and in-state residency both lead to a competitive department, and a competitive department leads to admission acceptance, the male gender alone is not sufficient to cause rejection.<|eot_id|>",
