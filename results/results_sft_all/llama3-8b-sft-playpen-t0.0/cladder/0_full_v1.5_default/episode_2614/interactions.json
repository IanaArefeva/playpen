The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 57%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 1%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 97%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 92%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 54%. The overall probability of smoking is 45%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than that among nonsmokers in both scenarios with and without a high tar deposit. This suggests that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is more complex than a direct cause-and-effect relationship. The higher probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with a high tar deposit compared to those without a high tar deposit further blurs the direct link between smoking and lung cancer.||",
