The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and freckles. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on freckles. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of freckles is 47%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of freckles is 35%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of clean water is 54%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of clean water is 13%. Will clean water decrease the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since clean water is associated with higher water quality, and higher water quality is associated with lower probability of freckles, we can conclude that clean water will decrease the chance of freckles.||",
