The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 19%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 71%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 25%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 57%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 26%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 58%. The overall probability of smoking is 38%. Will smoking increase the chance of being allergic to peanuts?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher for both nonsmokers and smokers when they have a high tar deposit, which is a direct effect of smoking. This suggests that the increase in the probability of being allergic to peanuts among smokers might be due to the higher probability of having a high tar deposit rather than a direct effect of smoking on the probability of being allergic to peanuts.<|eot_id|>",
