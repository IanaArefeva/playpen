Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 52%. For smokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 43%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see being lactose intolerant if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between effort and being lactose intolerant is that higher effort leads to a lower probability of being lactose intolerant. Since the student is already a smoker, the additional condition of being a nonsmoker would not change the probability of being lactose intolerant, as the direct relationship between being a smoker and being lactose intolerant already supersedes the relationship between being a nonsmoker and being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
