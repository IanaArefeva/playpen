The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 52%. For smokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 43%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see being lactose intolerant if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between effort and being lactose intolerant is that higher effort leads to a lower probability of being lactose intolerant. Since the student is already a smoker, the additional condition of being a nonsmoker would not change the probability of being lactose intolerant, as the direct relationship between being a smoker and being lactose intolerant already supersedes the relationship between being a nonsmoker and being lactose intolerant.||",
