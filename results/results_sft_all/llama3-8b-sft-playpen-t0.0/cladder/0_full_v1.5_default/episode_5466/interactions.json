The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of playing card games is 99%. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 49%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 60%. Is long lifespan more likely than short lifespan overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of long lifespan is higher for card game players (60%) than for non-players (49%), it might initially seem like card games are associated with a higher likelihood of long lifespan. However, we must consider the direct effect of card games on diabetes and its subsequent impact on lifespan. If card games lead to a higher risk of diabetes, which in turn shortens lifespan, then the overall probability of long lifespan might still be lower than that of short lifespan, especially given the high probability of card game play (99%).||",
