The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who cannot swim, the probability of high exam score is 20%. For students who can swim, the probability of high exam score is 56%. Will being able to swim decrease the chance of high exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This positive relationship supersedes any potential negative effects that might stem from the interaction between ability to swim and studying habits.<|eot_id|>",
