Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 41%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 2%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 2%.

Since 59% of the population is unattractive and 41% is attractive, the overall probability of having talent is 0.59 * 0.02 = 0.0118, which is less than the probability of lacking talent (1 - 0.02 = 0.98).<|eot_id|>",
