The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 17%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 43%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 18%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high tar deposit for a smoker is 64%. Since the probability of lung cancer is higher when there is a high tar deposit (43%) than when there is no tar deposit (17%), and the probability of high tar deposit is 64% for a smoker, it is more likely for a smoker to have a high tar deposit than no tar deposit. This means that the higher probability of lung cancer associated with a high tar deposit will likely counteract the lower probability of lung cancer associated with being a smoker, making it more likely for a smoker to have lung cancer than a nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
