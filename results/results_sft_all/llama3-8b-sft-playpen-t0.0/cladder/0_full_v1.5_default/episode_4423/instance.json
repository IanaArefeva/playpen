  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 46%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 77%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 17%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 43%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 18%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the person had been a nonsmoker?",
