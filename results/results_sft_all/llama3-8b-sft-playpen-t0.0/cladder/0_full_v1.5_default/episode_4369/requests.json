The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 53%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 94%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 44%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 69%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 31%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 55%. The overall probability of smoking is 63%. Will smoking increase the chance of being allergic to peanuts?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship is between smoke (or rather, the condition of being a smoker) and the probability of having a high tar deposit, and between the condition of having a high tar deposit and the probability of being allergic to peanuts. The condition of being a smoker does not directly increase the probability of being allergic to peanuts; rather, it does so by increasing the probability of having a high tar deposit, which in turn increases the probability of being allergic to peanuts.<|eot_id|>",
