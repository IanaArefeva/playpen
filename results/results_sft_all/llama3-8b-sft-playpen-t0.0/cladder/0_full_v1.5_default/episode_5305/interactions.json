The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who do not like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 63%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 42%. For individuals who like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 38%. For individuals who like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 21%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 70%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 48%. For individuals who like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 40%. For individuals who like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 19%. The overall probability of high skill level is 82%. Does liking spicy food negatively affect salary through occupation?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between occupation and salary is clear, but the relationship between liking spicy food and occupation is more complex. The probability of white-collar job is higher for those who like spicy food and have high skill levels (19%) than for those who like spicy food and have low skill levels (40%). This suggests that the positive effect of skill on occupation is more pronounced than the negative effect of liking spicy food on occupation. The probability of white-collar job is also higher for those who like spicy food and have high skill levels than for those who like spicy food and have low skill levels, which further supports the idea that the positive effect of skill on occupation is more significant than the negative effect of liking spicy food on occupation.||",
