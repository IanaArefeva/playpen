The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of male gender is 13%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 51%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 45%. Is being lactose intolerant less likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The net effect is that being male still has a lower probability of being lactose intolerant than being non-male, which is the opposite of the statement that being lactose intolerant is less likely than not being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
