Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 13%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 62%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 13%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer given smoking is 13%, which is the same as the overall probability of lung cancer. This suggests that the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is neutralized by the intervening variable of tar deposit, and the overall probability of lung cancer remains the same whether or not we condition on smoking.<|eot_id|>",
