The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and lip thickness. Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 6%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 38%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 63%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 95%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 50%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see thick lips if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The treatment also has a direct effect on thick lips, and this interaction between kidney stone size and treatment is what really matters. In particular, we see that for both small and large kidney stone sizes, the probability of thick lips is higher when the patient is receiving treatment than when they are not. This suggests that the treatment is having a positive effect on thick lips, and this effect is not being overwhelmed by the negative effect of large kidney stone size. In other words, the positive effect of the treatment on thick lips is strong enough to counteract the negative effect of large kidney stone size, and this is what we see in the data.||",
