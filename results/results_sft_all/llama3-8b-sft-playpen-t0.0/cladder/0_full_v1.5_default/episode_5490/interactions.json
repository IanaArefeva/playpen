The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 5%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 49%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 32%. Is curly hair less likely than straight hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the overall probability of having curly hair is a weighted average of the two groups: (0.05 * 0.32) + (0.95 * 0.49) = 0.0464 + 0.4655 = 0.5119. Since this is higher than the probability of straight hair (0.49), we conclude that curly hair is more likely than straight hair overall.||",
