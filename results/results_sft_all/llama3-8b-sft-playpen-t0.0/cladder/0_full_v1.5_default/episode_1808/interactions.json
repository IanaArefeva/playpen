The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and penguin survival. Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are sad, the probability of penguin death is 75%. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are happy, the probability of penguin death is 73%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are sad, the probability of penguin death is 16%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are happy, the probability of penguin death is 32%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin happiness is 20%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin happiness is 100%. If we disregard the mediation effect through penguin mood, would my decision positively affect penguin survival?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
