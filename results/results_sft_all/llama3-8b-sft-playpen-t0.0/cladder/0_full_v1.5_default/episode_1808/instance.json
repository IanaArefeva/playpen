Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are sad, the probability of penguin death is 75%. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are happy, the probability of penguin death is 73%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are sad, the probability of penguin death is 16%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are happy, the probability of penguin death is 32%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin happiness is 20%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin happiness is 100%. If we disregard the mediation effect through penguin mood, would my decision positively affect penguin survival?",
