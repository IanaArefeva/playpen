Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 57%. The probability of reduced supply and increased price is 20%. The probability of increased supply and increased price is 43%. Is the chance of increased price larger when observing increased supply?",
