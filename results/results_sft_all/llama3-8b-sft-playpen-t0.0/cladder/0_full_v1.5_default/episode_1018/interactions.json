The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how supply correlates with price case by case according to demand. Method 2: We look directly at how supply correlates with price in general. To understand how supply affects price, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this case, looking at the general relationship between supply and price (Method 2) is more appropriate than looking at the relationship on a case-by-case basis according to demand (Method 1). This is because demand is unobserved, and looking at the general relationship between supply and price allows us to control for demand and focus on the direct effect of supply on price. In contrast, looking at the relationship on a case-by-case basis according to demand (Method 1) would likely lead to confounding by demand, which is unobserved.||",
