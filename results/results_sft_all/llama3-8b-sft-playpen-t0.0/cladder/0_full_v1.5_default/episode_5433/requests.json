Effort has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of smoking is 87%. The probability of nonsmoking and freckles is 7%. The probability of smoking and freckles is 34%. Is the chance of freckles smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between effort and freckles is also positive, meaning that higher effort directly leads to more freckles. Since the probability of smoking is 87%, and the probability of both smoking and freckles is 34%, it's clear that the occurrence of freckles is more likely when someone smokes than when they don't. The additional positive relationship between effort and freckles further solidifies this connection, as higher effort directly leads to more freckles.<|eot_id|>",
