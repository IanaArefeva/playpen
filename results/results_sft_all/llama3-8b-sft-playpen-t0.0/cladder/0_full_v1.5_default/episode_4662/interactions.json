The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 35%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 76%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 42%. Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of large feet is higher for those who don't sign the letter, and the overall probability of manager signing the letter is 35%, we can conclude that large feet are more likely than small feet for those who don't sign the letter. Since the probability of large feet is higher for those who don't sign the letter, and the probability of large feet is lower for those who sign the letter, we can conclude that large feet are more likely than small feet for those who sign the letter. Since the overall probability of large feet is the weighted average of the probabilities of large feet for those who sign and those who don't sign the letter, we can conclude that large feet are more likely than small feet overall.||",
