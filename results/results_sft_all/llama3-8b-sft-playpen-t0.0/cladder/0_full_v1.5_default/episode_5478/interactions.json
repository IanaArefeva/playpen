The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 73%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 54%. For patients consuming citrus, would it be less likely to see curly hair if the patient had not consumed citrus?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having curly hair is not directly related to whether the person consumed citrus or not; it is only related to the citrus consumption. If a person consumed citrus, their probability of having curly hair is 54%, and if they did not consume citrus, their probability is 73%.
