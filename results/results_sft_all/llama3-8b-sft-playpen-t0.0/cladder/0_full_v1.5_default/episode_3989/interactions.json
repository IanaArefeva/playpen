The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 35%. For children who like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 75%. Will liking spicy food decrease the chance of intelligent child?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence is also positive, which means that higher social status parents are likely to have more intelligent children. Since the direct effect of liking spicy food on child's intelligence is positive and separate from the direct effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence, we can conclude that liking spicy food will not decrease the chance of an intelligent child.||",
