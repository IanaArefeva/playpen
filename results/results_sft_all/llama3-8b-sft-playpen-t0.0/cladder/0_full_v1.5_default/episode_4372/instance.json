For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 58%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 49%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 77%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 27%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 62%. The overall probability of smoking is 58%.
