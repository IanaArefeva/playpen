The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 5%. The probability of not liking spicy food and high salary is 50%. The probability of liking spicy food and high salary is 2%. Is the chance of high salary smaller when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of not liking spicy food and having a high salary is 50%, while the probability of liking spicy food and having a high salary is 2%. This does not directly imply that the chance of a high salary is smaller when observing liking spicy food, as the 2% probability still places a positive relationship between liking spicy food and high salary.||",
