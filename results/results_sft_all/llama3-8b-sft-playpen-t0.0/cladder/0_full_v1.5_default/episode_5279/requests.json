Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of freckles is 68%. For individuals who are male, the probability of freckles is 38%. Will male gender increase the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This relationship is not inverted by the additional information about the direct effects of department competitiveness and residency status on freckles, as the primary relationship between male gender and freckles remains direct and negative.<|eot_id|>",
