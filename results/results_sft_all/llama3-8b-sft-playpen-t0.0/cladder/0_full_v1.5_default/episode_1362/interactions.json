The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 7%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 68%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of being a smoker is 7%, and the probability of being a nonsmoker is 93% (100% - 7%). The probability of lung cancer among smokers is 79%, and the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers is 68%. The overall probability of lung cancer is (0.07 * 0.79) + (0.93 * 0.68) = 0.0553 + 0.6354 = 0.6907. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.6907 = 0.3093. Since 0.6907 is less than 0.5, the probability of lung cancer is less than the probability of absence of lung cancer, and lung cancer is less likely than absence of lung cancer overall.||",
