The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 46%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 38%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 88%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that having a college degree is a strong predictor of high salary. The probability of college degree or higher is 46%, which means that almost half of the population has this degree. Since the probability of high salary is higher for those with a college degree than for those without, and since a large proportion of the population has a college degree, it is likely that the overall probability of high salary is higher than that of low salary.||",
