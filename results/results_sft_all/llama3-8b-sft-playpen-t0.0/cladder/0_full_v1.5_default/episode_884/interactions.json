The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 23%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 28%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 51%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 53%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 42%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 25%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 93%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 74%. The overall probability of confounder active is 44%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would parents' intelligence negatively affect child's intelligence?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
