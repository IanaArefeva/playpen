Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are sad, the probability of large feet is 11%. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are happy, the probability of large feet is 61%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are sad, the probability of large feet is 22%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are happy, the probability of large feet is 73%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin happiness is 37%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin happiness is 10%. If we disregard the mediation effect through penguin mood, would my decision negatively affect foot size?",
