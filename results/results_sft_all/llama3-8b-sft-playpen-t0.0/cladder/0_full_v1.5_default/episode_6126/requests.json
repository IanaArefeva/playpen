Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. We know that smoking causes being lazy. smoking and being hard-working causes being lactose intolerant.

Since we are given that the person is a nonsmoker, we can conclude that they are not being lazy, and by the direct relationship between being hard-working and being lactose intolerant, we can conclude that they are not being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
