The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 38%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 43%. For situations where there is a full moon, would it be less likely to see wet ground if there were a full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of the full moon on the ground supersedes the direct effect of the full moon on the weather and the subsequent direct effect of the weather on the ground. In other words, the full moon's direct positive effect on the ground is not offset by the full moon's positive effect on the weather and the subsequent positive effect of the weather on the ground.||",
