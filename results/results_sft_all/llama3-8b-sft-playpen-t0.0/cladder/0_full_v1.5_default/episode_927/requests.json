The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 4%. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 58%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 52%. Is college admission more likely than college rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between effort and college admission is that higher effort leads to higher college admission probability. Since the probability of college admission is lower for smokers than for nonsmokers, and there is no direct relationship between smoking and higher college admission probability, we conclude that college admission is not more likely than college rejection overall.<|eot_id|>",
