The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 11%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 35%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 8%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The two direct effects are independent of each other, and the joint probability of high rainfall and late wake-up is the same as the joint probability of high rainfall and on-time wake-up.||",
