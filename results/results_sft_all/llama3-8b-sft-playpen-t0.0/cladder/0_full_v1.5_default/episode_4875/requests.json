Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 11%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 35%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 8%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is because the direct effect of Alice's wake-up time on rainfall is separate from the direct effect of the time of day on rainfall. The two direct effects are independent of each other, and the joint probability of high rainfall and late wake-up is the same as the joint probability of high rainfall and on-time wake-up.<|eot_id|>",
