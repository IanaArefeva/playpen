The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 52%. The probability of nonsmoking and being allergic to peanuts is 16%. The probability of smoking and being allergic to peanuts is 26%. Is the chance of being allergic to peanuts smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being both a smoker and having a peanut allergy is higher than the probability of being a smoker, it's likely that the direct relationship between smoking and the probability of having a peanut allergy is positive. This positive relationship would imply that the chance of being allergic to peanuts is larger when observing smoking, not smaller.<|eot_id|>",
