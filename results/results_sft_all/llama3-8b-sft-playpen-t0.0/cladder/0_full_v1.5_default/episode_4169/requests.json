Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of having a brother is 51%. For patients who do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 65%. For patients who have a brother, the probability of recovery is 45%. Is recovery less likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since having a brother directly affects recovery, we need to consider the joint probability of having a brother and the associated probability of recovery. The probability of having a brother is 51%, and for those who have a brother, the probability of recovery is 45%. This means that 0.51 * 0.45 = 0.2295 of the population will have a brother and not recover. In contrast, the probability of not having a brother is 0.49, and for those without a brother, the probability of recovery is 0.65. This yields 0.49 * 0.65 = 0.3185 of the population not having a brother and still not recovering. Since 0.2295 is less than 0.3185, the joint probability of having a brother and not recovering is lower than the joint probability of not having a brother and not recovering. This indicates that, overall, recovery is more likely than non-recovery.<|eot_id|>",
