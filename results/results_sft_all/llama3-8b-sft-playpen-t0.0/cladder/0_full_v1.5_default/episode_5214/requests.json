The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 43%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 83%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 18%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 53%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 88%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 30%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender negatively affect lactose intolerance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being lactose intolerant is higher for women than for men in both competitive and non-competitive departments. In the competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 83% for women and 53% for men. In the non-competitive department, the probability is 43% for women and 18% for men. This positive relationship between gender and lactose intolerance holds across both competitive and non-competitive contexts, which means that, in this specific world, being female directly increases the likelihood of being lactose intolerant, rather than decreasing it.<|eot_id|>",
