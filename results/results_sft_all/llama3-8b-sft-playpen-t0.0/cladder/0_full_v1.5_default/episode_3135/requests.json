The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. We know that high poverty and global water company causes clean water. high poverty or clean water causes cholera contraction. We observed the person is served by a local water company and the region has high poverty. Would the person avoids cholera if clean water instead of polluted water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we also know that high poverty and local water company cause clean water, we can conclude that the person is likely to have clean water. Additionally, we are given that clean water is associated with a lower risk of cholera. Therefore, the person is likely to have clean water and, as a result, is likely to avoid cholera.<|eot_id|>",
