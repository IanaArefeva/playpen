The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 17%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 38%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 72%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of waking up on time is 83% (100% - 17% late), and the probability of arriving to school on time given that she wakes up on time is 38%. The probability of Alice arriving to school on time is then 0.83 * 0.38 = 0.316. The probability of Alice arriving to school late is 1 - 0.316 = 0.684. Since 0.684 is greater than 0.316, it is more likely that Alice will arrive to school late than on time.<|eot_id|>",
