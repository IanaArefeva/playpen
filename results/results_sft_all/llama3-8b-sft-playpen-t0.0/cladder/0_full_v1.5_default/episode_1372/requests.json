Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. Does smoking negatively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, which directly indicates that smoking has a positive effect on the risk of lung cancer. The role of tar deposit is to bridge the gap between smoking and lung cancer, but it does not imply that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is negative.<|eot_id|>",
