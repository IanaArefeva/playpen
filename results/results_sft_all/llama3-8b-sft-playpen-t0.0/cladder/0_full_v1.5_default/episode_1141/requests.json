The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 5%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 36%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 63%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 95%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 53%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The counterfactual of interest is: \"If a patient with a large kidney stone is already receiving treatment, would they be more likely to see recovery if they had not been treated in the first place?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the following counterfactuals:\n- A patient with a large kidney stone and already receiving treatment: The probability of recovery is 95%.\n- A patient with a large kidney stone and not receiving treatment: The probability of recovery is 63%.\n\nGiven that the probability of large kidney stone is 53%, we can conclude that the counterfactual of a patient with a large kidney stone and not receiving treatment is more likely than the counterfactual of a patient with a large kidney stone and already receiving treatment. This is because the large kidney stone condition is more likely than the already receiving treatment condition. Since the counterfactual of a patient with a large kidney stone and not receiving treatment has a lower probability of recovery than the counterfactual of a patient with a large kidney stone and already receiving treatment, we conclude that it is less likely to see recovery if the patient had not been treated in the first place.<|eot_id|>",
