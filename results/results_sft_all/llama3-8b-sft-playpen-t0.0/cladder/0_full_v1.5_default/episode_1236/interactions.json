The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 69%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 31%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 55%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 53%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 94%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of high tar deposit is so high for a smoker, the overall probability of lung cancer for a smoker is likely to be close to the higher value of 55%. In contrast, the probability of lung cancer for a nonsmoker is 44% with no tar deposit and 69% with high tar deposit. The probability of high tar deposit for a nonsmoker is 53%. Since the probability of high tar deposit is lower for a nonsmoker than for a smoker, the overall probability of lung cancer for a nonsmoker is likely to be lower than the higher value of 69%.||",
