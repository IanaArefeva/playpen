Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 71%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 24%. For days when Alice wakes up late, would it be less likely to see arriving to school on time if Alice had gotten up on time?",
