Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 18%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 46%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 77%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 17%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 43%. The overall probability of smoking is 49%. Does smoking positively affect peanut allergy through tar deposit?",
