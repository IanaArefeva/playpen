The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and lip thickness. Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 0%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 31%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 58%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 91%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 53%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see thick lips if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the size of the kidney stone is a more important factor in determining the probability of thick lips than the receipt of treatment. Since the probability of thick lips is higher for large kidney stone patients than for small kidney stone patients, and this difference holds both with and without treatment, we can conclude that the size of the kidney stone is the primary driver of the probability of thick lips.<|eot_id|>",
