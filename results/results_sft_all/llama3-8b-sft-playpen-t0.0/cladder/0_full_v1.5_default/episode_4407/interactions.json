The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 44%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 76%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 16%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 55%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 43%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In both scenarios, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher than the corresponding probability for a nonsmoker (44% and 76%, respectively). This suggests that the direct effect of being a smoker on being allergic to peanuts is positive, and the additional effect of having a high tar deposit further increases this probability. Since the direct effect of being a smoker on being allergic to peanuts is positive, it is not less likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the person had been a nonsmoker.||",
