The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 74%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 72%. Will male gender increase the chance of admission acceptance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This reduction in probability is not offset by any positive effects of male gender on other variables that might influence admission acceptance. In particular, the direct effect of male gender on department competitiveness is not known, and the direct effect of male gender on residency status is also not known. Since the direct effect of male gender on admission acceptance is negative, and there is no known positive offsetting effect, male gender will reduce the chance of admission acceptance.<|eot_id|>",
