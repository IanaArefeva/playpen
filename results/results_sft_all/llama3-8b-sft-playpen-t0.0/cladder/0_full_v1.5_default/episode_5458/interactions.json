The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 56%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. For people who play card games, would it be more likely to see long lifespan if the person did not play card games?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is negative, with a 16% decrease in the probability of long lifespan for those with diabetes. The direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan is also negative, with a 16% decrease in the probability of long lifespan for those who smoke.
