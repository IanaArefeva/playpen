The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 43%. For individuals who are not male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 50%. For individuals who are male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 67%. For individuals who are male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 91%. For individuals who are not male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 1%. For individuals who are not male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 34%. For individuals who are male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 10%. For individuals who are male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 11%. The overall probability of high skill level is 18%. If we disregard the mediation effect through occupation, would gender negatively affect salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between skill and occupation further suggests that the positive relationship between male and white-collar occupation is likely to be the primary driver of the positive relationship between male and high salary. The direct relationship between occupation and salary also implies that the positive relationship between white-collar occupation and high salary is likely to be the primary driver of the positive relationship between male and high salary. The direct relationship between skill and occupation further suggests that the positive relationship between male and white-collar occupation is likely to be the primary driver of the positive relationship between male and high salary. The direct relationship between occupation and salary also implies that the positive relationship between white-collar occupation and high salary is likely to be the primary driver of the positive relationship between male and high salary.<|eot_id|>",
