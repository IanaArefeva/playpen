The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 1%. The probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm is 64%. The probability of having a brother and ringing alarm is 0%. Is the chance of ringing alarm larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of having a brother is 1%, and the probability of having a brother and ringing an alarm is 0%, it's clear that having a brother does not directly lead to a higher chance of the alarm clock ringing. In fact, the alarm clock's behavior is entirely dependent on the wife's behavior, and the probability of the alarm clock ringing is not directly affected by the presence of a brother.||",
