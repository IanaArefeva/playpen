Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 96%. The probability of not taking medication and healthy heart is 1%. The probability of taking medication and healthy heart is 47%. Is the chance of healthy heart larger when observing taking medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is because the probability of a healthy heart is conditionally independent of medication, and the direct effect of medication on heart condition is not strong enough to counteract the higher base rate of heart condition when not taking medication.<|eot_id|>",
