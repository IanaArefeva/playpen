The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 10%. For students who do not listen to jazz and rejected from elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 8%. For students who do not listen to jazz and accepted to elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 23%. For students who listen to jazz and rejected from elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 6%. For students who listen to jazz and accepted to elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 17%. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does the chance of being hard-working decrease when listening to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
