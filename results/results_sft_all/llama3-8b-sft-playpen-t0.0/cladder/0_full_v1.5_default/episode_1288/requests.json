The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 44%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 50%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of smoke is 44%, and the probability of lung cancer in the smoke group is 50%. The probability of no smoke is 56%, and the probability of lung cancer in the no smoke group is 44%. The higher probability of lung cancer in the smoke group than in the no smoke group, and the higher probability of smoke than of no smoke, imply that the overall probability of lung cancer is less than the probability of no lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
