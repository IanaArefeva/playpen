The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 29%. For individuals who have not visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 57%. For individuals who have visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 53%. For individuals who have visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 84%. For individuals who have not visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 13%. For individuals who have not visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 19%. For individuals who have visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 52%. For individuals who have visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 58%. The overall probability of high skill level is 20%. If we disregard the mediation effect through occupation, would having visited England negatively affect salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
