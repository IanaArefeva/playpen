The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on skin. Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 17%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 67%. For people who went to tanning salons, would it be more likely to see tanned skin if the person had not had a tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The beach visit does not directly influence the skin condition in this isolated world, so the beach visit does not change the already higher probability of tanned skin associated with tanning salon use.||",
