The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 48%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 62%. Will full moon increase the chance of wet ground?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a wet ground is already higher under a full moon (62%) than without one (48%). This difference in probability directly indicates that the full moon does not increase the chance of a wet ground; rather, it shifts the ground's condition from a 48% chance of being wet to a 62% chance of being wet.||",
