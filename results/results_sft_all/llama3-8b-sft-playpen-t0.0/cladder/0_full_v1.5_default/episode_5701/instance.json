Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 81%. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 85%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 65%. Is high infant mortality less likely than low infant mortality overall?",
