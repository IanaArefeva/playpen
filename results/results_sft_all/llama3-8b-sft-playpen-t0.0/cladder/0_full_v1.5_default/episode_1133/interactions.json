The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 3%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 33%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 60%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 93%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 49%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\n\nLet's consider the following counterfactuals:\n- If a patient has a small kidney stone and does not receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 3%.\n- If a patient has a small kidney stone and does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 33%.\n\nNext, we need to consider the counterfactuals for large kidney stones:\n- If a patient has a large kidney stone and does not receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 60%.\n- If a patient has a large kidney stone and does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 93%.\n\nGiven that the overall probability of large kidney stone is 49%, we can conclude that the probability of having a large kidney stone is higher than that of having a small kidney stone. This is a critical insight, as it directly affects the counterfactuals and our ability to reason about the relationships between the variables.\n\nNow, consider the following counterfactual: if a patient has a large kidney stone and does not receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 60%. This is higher than the probability of recovery for a patient with a small kidney stone and no treatment (3%).\n\nNext, consider the counterfactual: if a patient has a large kidney stone",
