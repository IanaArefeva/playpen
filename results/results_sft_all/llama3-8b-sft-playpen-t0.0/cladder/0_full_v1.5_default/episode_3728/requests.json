The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drinking coffee and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 32%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of high salary is 34%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of high salary is 63%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The unobserved confounder's negative effect on coffee consumption likely counteracts the positive direct effect of coffee consumption on higher salary, and its negative effect on higher salary likely counteracts the positive direct effect of coffee consumption on higher salary. The overall probability of high salary is not directly calculable from the given information, and we must consider the counteracting effects of the unobserved confounder.<|eot_id|>",
