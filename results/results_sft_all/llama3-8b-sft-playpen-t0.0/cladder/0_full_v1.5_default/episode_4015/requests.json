The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of smoking is 3%. The probability of nonsmoking and being lactose intolerant is 30%. The probability of smoking and being lactose intolerant is 2%. Is the chance of being lactose intolerant larger when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between effort and lactose intolerance is also not strong, as the probability of being both an active person and lactose intolerant is not directly quantified. The key relationship here is between smoking and effort, which is not directly quantified either. The most direct relationship is between being a nonsmoker and being lactose intolerant, which has a probability of 30%. This suggests that being a nonsmoker is more closely associated with being lactose intolerant than being a smoker.<|eot_id|>",
