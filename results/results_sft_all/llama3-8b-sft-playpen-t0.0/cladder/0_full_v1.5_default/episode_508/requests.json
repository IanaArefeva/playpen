Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 43%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 10%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 10%.

Since 57% of the population is unattractive and 43% is attractive, the overall probability of having talent is the same as the probability of being unattractive (57% of 10% is 5.7%, and 43% of 10% is 4.3%, so the total probability of having talent is 5.7% + 4.3% = 10%). The probability of lacking talent is the same as the probability of having talent (10% for unattractive and 90% for attractive, so the total probability of lacking talent is 10% + 90% = 100%).<|eot_id|>",
