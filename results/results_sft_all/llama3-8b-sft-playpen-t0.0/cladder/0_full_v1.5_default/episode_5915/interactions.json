The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and freckles. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on freckles. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of clean water is 26%. For people with only polluted water, the probability of freckles is 33%. For people with access to clean water, the probability of freckles is 63%. Is freckles more likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The remaining 74% of the time, the water is likely to be polluted, and in those cases, the probability of freckles is 33%.
