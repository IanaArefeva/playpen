The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 10%. The probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 77%. The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 6%. Is the chance of long lifespan larger when observing obesity?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 6%, which is lower than the probability of normal weight and long lifespan (77%). This suggests that there might be a negative relationship between obesity and long lifespan. The direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan is also not clear, as the probability of long lifespan is not directly associated with the probability of smoking. The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is also not clear, as the probability of long lifespan is not directly associated with the probability of diabetes. The only clear direct relationship is between diabetes and long lifespan, which is a negative relationship. The direct relationship between obesity and long lifespan is not clear, and the direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan is not clear. The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is a negative relationship. The probability of long lifespan is higher when the person is of normal weight (77%) than when they are obese (6%).||",
