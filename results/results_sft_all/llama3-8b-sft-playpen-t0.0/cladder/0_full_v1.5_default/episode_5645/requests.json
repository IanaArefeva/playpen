Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of speaking english is 48%. The probability of not speaking english and recovery is 13%. The probability of speaking english and recovery is 36%.

The probability of not speaking English and recovery is 13%, which is lower than the probability of speaking English and recovery (36%). This suggests that the ability to speak English is associated with a higher likelihood of recovery, rather than a lower one.<|eot_id|>",
