The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 73%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 51%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of lung cancer is lower for smokers (51%) than for nonsmokers (73%), it suggests that the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is negative. This means that the reduction in lung cancer risk among smokers is likely due to the intervening effect of tar deposit, which counteracts the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer. If we condition on the person being a smoker, the intervening effect of tar deposit still occurs, and the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is still negative. Therefore, it is not more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker, as the intervening effect of tar deposit still counteracts the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer.||",
