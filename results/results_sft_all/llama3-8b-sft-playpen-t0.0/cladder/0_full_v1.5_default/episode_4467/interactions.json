The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. Will listening to jazz increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
