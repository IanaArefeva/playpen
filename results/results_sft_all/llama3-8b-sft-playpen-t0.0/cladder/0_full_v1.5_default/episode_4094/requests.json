Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 33%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 13%. Will citrus intake decrease the chance of curly hair?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This counterintuitive finding can be explained by the intervening role of vitamin C, which has a direct positive effect on curly hair. In this world, citrus consumption directly affects the body's vitamin C levels, which in turn directly affects the likelihood of having curly hair.<|eot_id|>",
