The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 38%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 87%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 2%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 52%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 41%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 92%. Does smoking negatively affect lactose intolerance through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of smoking on lactose intolerance is not clear from the given information. The probability of being lactose intolerant among smokers and hard-working individuals is 52%, which is higher than the probability among nonsmokers and hard-working individuals (87%). This suggests that, in this specific context, being a smoker might actually increase the likelihood of being lactose intolerant, rather than decreasing it.||",
