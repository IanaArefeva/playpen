Effort has a direct effect on freckles. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 40%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 74%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see freckles if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of effort on freckles is not quantified, but it is still a separate direct effect. If we condition on the student being a smoker, the direct effect of being a smoker on freckles still holds, and the additional direct effect of effort on freckles does not change the overall probability of freckles.<|eot_id|>",
