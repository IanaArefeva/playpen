The candle has a direct effect on room. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 87%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 55%. Will drinking coffee increase the chance of dark room?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
