The relationship between the two variables is still subject to the direct effects of both \"liking spicy food\" and \"attractive appearance\" on \"relationship status\". The negative correlation could be a result of the interaction between these direct effects, rather than a direct causal relationship between \"liking spicy food\" and \"attractive appearance\".<|eot_id|>",
