Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 37%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 71%. For days when Alice wakes up late, would it be more likely to see arriving to school on time if Alice had gotten up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the condition of Alice waking up late is associated with a higher probability of her arriving to school on time. If we condition on the event that Alice wakes up late, the additional information that she would have woken up on time does not change the probability of her arriving to school on time, which remains at 71%.<|eot_id|>",
