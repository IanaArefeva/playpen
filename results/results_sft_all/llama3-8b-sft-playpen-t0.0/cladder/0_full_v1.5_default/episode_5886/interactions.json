The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a brother and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Having a brother has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how having a brother correlates with infant's birth weight case by case according to unobserved confounders. Method 2: We look directly at how having a brother correlates with infant's birth weight in general. To understand how having a brother affects infant's birth weight, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between having a brother and infant's birth weight is the most reliable measure of their causal relationship in this isolated system. Method 1 involves looking at the relationship through the lens of unobserved confounders, which are not directly accessible and can lead to bias. In this carefully controlled environment, focusing on the direct relationship between having a brother and infant's birth weight provides a clear and unbiased measure of their causal connection.||",
