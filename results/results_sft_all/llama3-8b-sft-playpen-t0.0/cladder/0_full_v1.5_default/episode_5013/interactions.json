The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 95%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 28%. For people who have a sister, would it be less likely to see healthy heart if the person did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The blood pressure condition also exerts a direct effect on heart condition. Since having a sister directly affects blood pressure, and blood pressure in turn affects heart condition, we must consider the joint effect of having a sister and blood pressure on heart condition. In this case, the reduction in heart condition probability among those with a sister is primarily due to the higher blood pressure associated with having a sister, rather than the direct effect of having a sister on heart condition. If we control for blood pressure, the direct effect of having a sister on heart condition would likely be minimal, and the probability of a healthy heart would not be less likely if the person did not have a sister.||",
