The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Method 1: We look directly at how talent correlates with effort in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to elite institution admission status. To understand how talent affects effort, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the absence of any unmentioned factors or causal relationships, we should consider the direct effects of both talent and effort on the target variable (elite institution admission status) rather than focusing on the relationship between the two antecedent variables (talent and effort) in general. This is because we are specifically interested in how talent affects the target variable through its direct effect on the target, rather than through its relationship with another antecedent variable (effort) that also affects the target.<|eot_id|>",
