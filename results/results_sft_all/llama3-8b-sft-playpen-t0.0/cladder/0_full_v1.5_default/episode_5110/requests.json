Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 45%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 61%. For people who have a brother, would it be more likely to see high salary if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the positive effect of having a brother on salary is entirely mediated through the increase in skill. Since the person in question already has a brother, their skill is higher than it would be if they did not have a brother. The additional skill they have as a result of having a brother does not change the probability of having a high salary, which remains the same as for others who have a brother (61%).<|eot_id|>",
