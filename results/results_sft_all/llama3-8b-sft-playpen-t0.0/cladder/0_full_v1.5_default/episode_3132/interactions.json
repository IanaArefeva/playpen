The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. We know that high poverty or global water company causes clean water. high poverty or clean water causes cholera contraction. We observed the person is served by a local water company and the region has high poverty. Would the person gets cholera if polluted water instead of clean water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the person is not served by the global water company, we can conclude that the person is likely to have clean water. Additionally, the person's region has high poverty, which we know has a direct effect on water quality, but this does not directly imply that the person's water is polluted. In fact, the condition \"high poverty or clean water\" suggests that clean water is a possibility in this scenario. Since we already established that the person is likely to have clean water, and clean water has a direct effect on cholera, we can conclude that the person is not likely to get cholera.||",
