Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 81%. Will having a sister decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The correct relationship is that having a sister is associated with higher tar deposit, which in turn is associated with higher lung cancer risk. This means that having a sister does not directly reduce the chance of lung cancer; instead, it's the higher tar deposit that's the common cause behind the higher risk of lung cancer in people with a sister.<|eot_id|>",
