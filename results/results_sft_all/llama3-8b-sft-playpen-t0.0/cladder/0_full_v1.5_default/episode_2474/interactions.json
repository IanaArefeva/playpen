The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 94%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 80%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 18%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 5%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 58%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

          "content": "No\nThe key insight here is that the probability of large kidney stone is 58%, and the probability of recovery is 5% for large kidney stone patients who have not been treated, and 5% for large kidney stone patients who have been treated. This means that the difference in the probability of recovery between the two groups is not due to the treatment itself, but rather the large kidney stone condition. In other words, the treatment does not make a difference in the probability of recovery for large kidney stone patients. In contrast, for small kidney stone patients, the probability of recovery is 94% if not treated and 80% if treated, which means that the treatment does make a difference in the probability of recovery for small kidney stone patients. Since the large kidney stone condition is more common than the small kidney stone condition, the overall probability of seeing a patient with a large kidney stone who has not been treated is higher than the probability of seeing a patient with a small kidney stone who has not been treated. This is why, in this specific context, it is not more likely to see a patient with a large kidney stone who has not been treated than a patient with a small kidney stone who has not been treated.||",
