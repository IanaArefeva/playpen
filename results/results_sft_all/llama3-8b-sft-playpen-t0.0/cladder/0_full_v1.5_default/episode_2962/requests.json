Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender or in-state residency or competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the resident is in-state. Would the applicant gets rejected if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that in-state residency is a cause of competitive department, and we have observed that the applicant is in-state, we can conclude that the in-state residency is the cause of the competitive department in this case. The direct effect of competitive department on admission acceptance further implies that the competitive department is a cause of admission acceptance. Since we have already established that in-state residency is the cause of the competitive department, we can conclude that in-state residency is the cause of the admission acceptance in this case. Finally, the direct effect of male gender on admission acceptance and the direct effect of in-state residency on admission acceptance imply that male gender and in-state residency are both causes of admission acceptance. Since we have already established that in-state residency is the cause of the admission acceptance in this case, we can conclude that the in-state residency is the cause of the admission acceptance, and the male gender is not necessary for the admission acceptance in this case.<|eot_id|>",
