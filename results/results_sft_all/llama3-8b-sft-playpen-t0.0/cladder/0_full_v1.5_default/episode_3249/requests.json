The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of having visited England is 37%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 23%. For people who have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 66%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since having visited England directly affects the probability of the employee being fired (66% vs 23% for those who haven't), we need to consider the overall probability of having visited England (37%) and its impact on the probability of the employee being fired. If we condition on having visited England, the probability of the employee being fired is 66%, which is higher than the 23% probability for those who haven't. Since 37% of the population has visited England, we can conclude that the overall probability of the employee being fired is higher than the probability of the employee not being fired.<|eot_id|>",
