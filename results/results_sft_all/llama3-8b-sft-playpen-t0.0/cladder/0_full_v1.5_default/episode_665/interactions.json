The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 30%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 64%. For students who are encouraged, would it be more likely to see high exam score if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This indicates that encouragement has a positive effect on exam score. If a student who is encouraged still does not achieve a high exam score, it would imply that the student's exam score is independent of encouragement, which is not the case here. The direct relationship between encouragement and exam score means that encouragement directly affects exam score, and the higher probability of a high exam score for encouraged students shows that this relationship is positive.||",
