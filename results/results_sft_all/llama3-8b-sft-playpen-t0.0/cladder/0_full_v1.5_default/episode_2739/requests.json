The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 40%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and normal infant birth weight is 6%. The probability of smoking mother and normal infant birth weight is 17%. Is the chance of normal infant birth weight larger when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is because the probability of normal birth weight is higher in the case of a nonsmoking mother (6%) than in the case of a smoking mother (17%).<|eot_id|>",
