Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 91%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 81%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 30%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 15%. The overall probability of male gender is 44%.
