The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 87%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 73%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 22%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 4%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 45%. Will getting the vaccine decrease the chance of recovering from the disease?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of the vaccine on disease is positive, meaning it should reduce the chance of disease. However, the direct effect of the vaccine on disease is not the only thing at play here. The pre-conditions also have a direct effect on both the vaccine and the disease. In particular, having pre-conditions makes it more likely that you will get the vaccine (since you are more likely to be \"vulnerable\" and thus more likely to be vaccinated), and it also makes it less likely that you will recover from the disease (since you are more likely to have a bad outcome). \n\nGiven that the probability of pre-conditions is 45%, this means that a large fraction of the population will have pre-conditions and will get the vaccine. In this subpopulation, the vaccine actually makes it less likely that you will recover from the disease (4% vs. 22%). Since this subpopulation is large (45% of the total), the overall effect of the vaccine on the chance of recovering from the disease is negative.||",
