Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 53%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 15%. Will tanning salon treatment increase the chance of tanned skin?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that tanning salon treatment actually decreases the chance of tanned skin, rather than increasing it.<|eot_id|>",
