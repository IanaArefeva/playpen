The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 69%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 3%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 72%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 19%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 69%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 18%. The overall probability of smoking is 70%. Will smoking increase the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of freckles among smokers is lower than among nonsmokers in both the no tar and high tar scenarios. This suggests that the positive effect of smoking on freckles is offset by the negative effect of the associated higher probability of high tar deposit, which in turn leads to a lower probability of freckles.||",
