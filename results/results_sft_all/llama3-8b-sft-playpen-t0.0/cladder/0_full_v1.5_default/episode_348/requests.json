Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 36%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 88%.

The probability of tanned skin is also directly affected by the action of \"going to the beach\". The probability of tanned skin for people not using tanning salon treatments is 36%, which is higher than the 0% probability for people who have not used tanning salon treatments and have not gone to the beach. This suggests that \"going to the beach\" has a positive effect on skin, separate from the effect of tanning salon treatment. Since the probability of tanned skin for people who have used tanning salon treatments is 88%, and this is still lower than the 100% probability for people who have used tanning salon treatments and have also gone to the beach, we can conclude that tanning salon treatment does not increase the chance of tanned skin.<|eot_id|>",
