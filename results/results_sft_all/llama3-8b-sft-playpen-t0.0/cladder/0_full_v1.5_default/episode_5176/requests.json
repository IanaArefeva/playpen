The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Brown eyes has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Method 1: We look directly at how talent correlates with brown eyes in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to elite institution admission status. To understand how talent affects brown eyes, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between talent and brown eyes is being asked, not the relationship between talent and elite institution admission status. In this case, looking at the general correlation between talent and brown eyes (Method 1) is more appropriate than examining this relationship on a case-by-case basis according to elite institution admission status (Method 2), which would be more suitable for understanding the relationship between brown eyes and elite institution admission status.<|eot_id|>",
