Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that waking up late and heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is no traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if waking up late instead of waking up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that there is no traffic, the condition of \"waking up late\" does not lead to a late arrival. In this isolated system, the direct effect of \"waking up late\" is neutralized by the absence of \"traffic\", which is the primary cause of late arrival.<|eot_id|>",
