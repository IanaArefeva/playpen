The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and peanut allergy. Treatment has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of receives treatment is 52%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 46%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 64%. Is being allergic to peanuts less likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
