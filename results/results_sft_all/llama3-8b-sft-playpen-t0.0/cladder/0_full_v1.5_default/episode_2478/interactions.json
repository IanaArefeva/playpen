The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 95%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 81%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 17%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 6%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 54%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\n\nLet's first examine the counterfactuals for the large kidney stone group. If we condition on large kidney stone size, the probability of recovery without treatment is 17%, and with treatment is 6%. This means that, in the counterfactual where the kidney stone size is large, treatment actually decreases the probability of recovery from 17% to 6%.\n\nNext, we need to consider the counterfactuals for the small kidney stone group. If we condition on small kidney stone size, the probability of recovery without treatment is 95%, and with treatment is 81%. This means that, in the counterfactual where the kidney stone size is small, treatment still has a positive effect on the probability of recovery, increasing it from 95% to 81%.\n\nGiven that the overall probability of large kidney stone is 54%, we can conclude that, in the counterfactual where the kidney stone size is large, treatment will decrease the probability of recovery. Since the counterfactual where the kidney stone size is large is more likely than the counterfactual where the kidney stone size is small, the overall effect of treatment on the probability of recovery will be negative.||",
