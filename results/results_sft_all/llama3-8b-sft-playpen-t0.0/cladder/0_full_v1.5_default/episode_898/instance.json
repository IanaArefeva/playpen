For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 95%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 26%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 63%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 86%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 7%.
