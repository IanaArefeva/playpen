Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of playing card games is 96%. The probability of not playing card games and long lifespan is 3%. The probability of playing card games and long lifespan is 54%. Is the chance of long lifespan larger when observing playing card games?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between diabetes and lifespan further solidifies the positive relationship between card games and lifespan. The high probability of card games (96%) and the high probability of card games and long lifespan (54%) support this positive relationship. The probability of not card games and long lifespan (3%) is lower than the probability of card games and long lifespan (54%), which further solidifies the positive relationship between card games and long lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
