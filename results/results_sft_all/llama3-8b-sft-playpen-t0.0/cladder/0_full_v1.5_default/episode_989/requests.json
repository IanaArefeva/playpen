The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 91%. The probability of absence of citrus and scurvy is 7%. The probability of citrus intake and scurvy is 36%. Is the chance of scurvy larger when observing citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of scurvy is the weighted average of the two scenarios: (0.07 * 0) + (0.09 * 0.36) = 0.0324. The probability of citrus is 0.91, and the probability of scurvy given citrus is 0.36, so the probability of scurvy given citrus is 0.91 * 0.36 = 0.3264. Since 0.3264 is larger than 0.0324, the chance of scurvy is larger when observing citrus intake.<|eot_id|>",
