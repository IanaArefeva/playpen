The probability of college admission is 88% for nonsmokers and 67% for smokers, and since 87% of the population smokes, we can weight these probabilities by the fraction of the population that smokes and the fraction that doesn't smoke. The overall probability of college admission is then (0.87 * 0.67) + (0.13 * 0.88) = 0.73 + 0.11 = 0.84, which is higher than the probability of college rejection (1 - 0.84 = 0.16).<|eot_id|>",
