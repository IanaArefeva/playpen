The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 6%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 42%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 76%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 87%. The overall probability of smoking is 58%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To fully understand the relationship between smoking and lung cancer, we need to consider the joint effect of both smoking and the associated risk of high tar deposit on the probability of lung cancer.\nGiven that the probability of high tar deposit is 42% for smokers and 6% for nonsmokers, and that the probability of lung cancer is 87% for smokers and with high tar deposit, we can conclude that the joint effect of smoking and high tar deposit on the probability of lung cancer is higher than the joint effect of being a nonsmoker and having high tar deposit.\nHowever, we also need to consider the joint effect of being a smoker and having no tar deposit on the probability of lung cancer, which is 52%. This is lower than the probability of lung cancer for a nonsmoker with no tar deposit, which is 33%. This suggests that the joint effect of being a smoker and having no tar deposit on the probability of lung cancer is lower than the joint effect of being a nonsmoker and having no tar deposit.\nGiven that the overall probability of smoking is 58%, we can conclude that the joint effect of being a smoker and having no tar deposit on the probability of lung cancer is lower than the joint effect of being a nonsmoker and having no tar deposit.\nTherefore, the joint effect of being a smoker on the probability of lung",
