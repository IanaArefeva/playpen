The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 39%. For people who do not have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 2%. For people who have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 66%. For people who have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 27%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 62%. For people who have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 41%. If we disregard the mediation effect through blood pressure, would having a sister positively affect heart condition?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a healthy heart is higher for people who have a sister and with low blood pressure (66%) than for those who do not have a sister and with the same condition (39%). This might imply a positive effect of having a sister on heart condition in the context of low blood pressure. In the case of high blood pressure, the probability of a healthy heart is lower for people who have a sister (27%) than for those who do not have a sister (2%). This could indicate a negative effect of having a sister on heart condition in the context of high blood pressure. Since the direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition is not clear, we need more information to conclude whether having a sister has a positive or negative effect on heart condition.||",
