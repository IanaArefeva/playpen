Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. We know that smoking causes absence of tar deposit, and we know that high tar deposit causes lung cancer. Would the person has no lung cancer if smoking instead of nonsmoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
