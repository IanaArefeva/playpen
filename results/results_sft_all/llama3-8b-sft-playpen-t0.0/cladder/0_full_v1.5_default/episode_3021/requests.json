Since we already know the patient is male, we can conclude that he would likely have received treatment. If we consider the counterfactual where the male patient does not receive treatment, we must account for the direct relationship between male gender and treatment. In this counterfactual, the male patient would still be male, and the direct relationship between male gender and treatment would still imply that he would have likely received treatment. Since we are now supposing that he does not receive treatment, we must conclude that the direct relationship between male gender and treatment is not strong enough to ensure that the male patient would always receive treatment. In this counterfactual, the male patient would not have the direct cause of treatment, and we must consider the direct relationship between male gender and recovery. In this counterfactual, the male patient still has the direct cause of male gender, which we already know is associated with a higher likelihood of recovery. Since we are supposing that the male patient does not have the direct cause of treatment, we must conclude that the direct relationship between male gender and recovery is not strong enough to ensure that the male patient would always recover.
