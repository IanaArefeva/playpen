The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how liking spicy food correlates with salary case by case according to occupation. Method 2: We look directly at how liking spicy food correlates with salary in general. To understand how liking spicy food affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Liking spicy food affects occupation, which in turn affects salary. If we directly look at the relationship between liking spicy food and salary (Method 2), we would be confounding the direct effect of occupation on salary with the indirect effect of occupation on salary through its relationship with liking spicy food. This would lead to an overestimation of the effect of liking spicy food on salary. In contrast, looking at the relationship between liking spicy food and occupation, and then looking at the relationship between occupation and salary (Method 1), we can more accurately disentangle the direct and indirect effects of liking spicy food on salary.<|eot_id|>",
