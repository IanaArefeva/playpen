The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 9%. The probability of not blowing out the candle and dark room is 79%. The probability of blowing out the candle and dark room is 5%. Is the chance of dark room larger when observing blowing out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
