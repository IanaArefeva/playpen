The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 20%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 82%. Will intelligent parents decrease the chance of intelligent child?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between parents' social status and child's intelligence is also positive, meaning that higher social status parents are more likely to have an intelligent child. The probability of an intelligent child given intelligent parents is 82%, which is higher than the probability of an intelligent child given unintelligent parents (20%).
