The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 30%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 73%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 36%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the manager signing the termination letter is 30%, and in this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 36%. To find the overall probability of the employee being fired, we need to consider both scenarios: the manager not signing the letter and the manager signing the letter. The overall probability of the manager not signing the letter is 0.7, and the probability of the manager being fired in this case is 0.73. The overall probability of the manager signing the letter is 0.3, and the probability of the manager being fired in this case is 0.36. The overall probability of the manager being fired is the sum of the two scenarios: 0.7 * 0.73 = 0.511 and 0.3 * 0.36 = 0.108. The total probability of the manager being fired is 0.619, and the total probability of the manager not being fired is 1 - 0.619 = 0.381.||",
