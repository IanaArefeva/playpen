The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 37%. The probability of nonsmoking and freckles is 36%. The probability of smoking and freckles is 21%. Is the chance of freckles smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This active process of tar deposit formation likely supersedes the direct relationship between gender and freckles, which is not directly involved in the formation of freckles. The active process of tar deposit formation likely supersedes the direct relationship between gender and freckles, which is not directly involved in the formation of freckles.<|eot_id|>",
