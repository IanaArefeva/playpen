The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 24%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 34%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 60%. Is the forest on fire less likely than the forest not on fire overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the forest on fire is 24% for those who like spicy food and 26% for those who smoke. The probability of the forest on fire is 34% for those who do not like spicy food and smoke. The forest is on fire if the person either smokes or likes spicy food, so we need to consider the joint probability of the forest on fire and the person either smoking or liking spicy food. The probability of the forest on fire and the person either smoking or liking spicy food is the sum of the probability of the forest on fire and the person smoking (26%) and the probability of the forest on fire and the person liking spicy food (24%). The probability of the forest on fire and the person either smoking or liking spicy food is 26% + 24% = 50%. The probability of the forest not on fire and the person either smoking or liking spicy food is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. The forest is on fire if the person either smokes or likes spicy food, so we need to consider the joint probability of the forest on fire and the person either smoking or liking spicy food.
