For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 54%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 14%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 42%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 9%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 34%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 6%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 66%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 30%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 88%.
