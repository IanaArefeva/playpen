The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 54%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 14%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 42%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 9%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 34%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 6%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 66%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 30%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 88%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect admission status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The table only shows the probability of admission acceptance for different subgroups, but it does not directly link the probability of being male (or female) to the probability of being admitted. The table does show that being male is associated with lower probabilities of admission acceptance in both competitive and non-competitive departments, which might lead one to conclude that being male has a negative effect on admission status.<|eot_id|>",
