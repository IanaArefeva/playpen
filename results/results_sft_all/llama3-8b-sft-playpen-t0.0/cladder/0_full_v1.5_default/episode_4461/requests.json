The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 3%. The probability of not listening to jazz and lung cancer is 50%. The probability of listening to jazz and lung cancer is 2%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing listening to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between pollution and lung cancer is also positive, and since we do not have direct information about the relationship between jazz and pollution, we must consider the joint relationship between all three. The probability of not listening to jazz and lung cancer is 50%, and the probability of both not listening to jazz and not having lung cancer is 97% (100% - 3% - 2% - 1%). This means that the probability of having lung cancer when not listening to jazz is 3% (50% - 47%). The probability of having lung cancer when listening to jazz is 2%. Since the probability of having lung cancer is higher when not listening to jazz than when listening to jazz, the chance of lung cancer is smaller when observing listening to jazz.<|eot_id|>",
