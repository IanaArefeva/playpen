The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 49%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 16%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 24%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer is higher in the smoking group than in the nonsmoking group, which is a direct result of the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer. The additional information that the probability of lung cancer is 16% in the nonsmoking group and 24% in the smoking group further solidifies this relationship.||",
