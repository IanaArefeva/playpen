The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 14%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 58%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 3%. Is the chance of intelligent child larger when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that parents' social status can also directly influence child's intelligence, separate from parents' intelligence. The probability of intelligent parents is 14%, and the probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 3%. This suggests that the direct relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence is not the only factor at play. The probability of intelligent child is also higher when parents are socialites (unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 58%), which indicates that parents' social status has a more significant impact on child's intelligence than parents' intelligence.||",
