Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 54%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 24%. Does eating citrus negatively affect scurvy through vitmain C?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of scurvy is lower for citrus consumers (24%) than for non-consumers (54%). This reduction in scurvy risk is a direct result of citrus consumption, which in turn directly affects vitmain C levels. The intervening role of vitmain C in this relationship means that citrus consumption exerts its effect on scurvy through this intermediate variable, rather than having a direct negative effect on scurvy.<|eot_id|>",
