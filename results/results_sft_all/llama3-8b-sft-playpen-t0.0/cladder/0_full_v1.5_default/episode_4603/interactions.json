The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 1%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 79%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 30%. Is ringing alarm less likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is also directly influenced by the wife's behavior, which is not directly related to having a brother. Since the probability of having a brother is only 1%, the vast majority of people (99%) do not have a brother. For this large group, the probability of the alarm clock ringing is 79%, which is higher than the 30% probability for those who do have a brother. This means that the overall probability of the alarm clock ringing is likely higher than the 30% associated with having a brother, making it more likely than not that the alarm clock will ring.||",
