The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to retain the employee. Would the employee is fired if not having visited England instead of having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the CEO's decision to fire the employee is what leads to having visited England, and having visited England is what leads to the employee being fired, we can conclude that the CEO's decision is the primary cause of the employee being fired. If the CEO had not made the decision to fire the employee, then having visited England would not have occurred, and the employee would not have been fired.||",
