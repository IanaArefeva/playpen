Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 64%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 25%. For days when Alice wakes up late, would it be more likely to see arriving to school on time if Alice had gotten up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key point here is that the condition of \"waking up late\" already sets a lower bound on the probability of arriving on time, which is 25%. If we consider the counterfactual where Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving on time is 64%, which is higher than the 25% bound set by the \"waking up late\" condition. This means that, in the counterfactual where Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving on time is higher than the lower bound set by the \"waking up late\" condition, and this higher probability is not directly related to the condition of \"waking up late\" itself.<|eot_id|>",
