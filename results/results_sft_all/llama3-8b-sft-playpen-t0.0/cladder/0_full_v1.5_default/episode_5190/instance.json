Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 74%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 36%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 50%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 15%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 76%.
