The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 11%. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 60%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 46%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 92%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 61%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 1%. Does husband negatively affect alarm clock through wife?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The wife's action of setting the alarm also directly affects the probability of the alarm ringing, and there is no intermediate relationship between the husband and the alarm clock through the wife. The husband's action of setting the alarm directly counteracts the negative effect of the wife not setting the alarm, as seen in the 46% and 92% probabilities of the alarm ringing when the husband sets the alarm.||",
