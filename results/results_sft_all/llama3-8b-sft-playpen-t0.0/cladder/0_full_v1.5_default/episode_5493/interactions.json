The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 11%. The probability of absence of citrus and curly hair is 67%. The probability of citrus intake and curly hair is 5%. Is the chance of curly hair smaller when observing citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The joint probability of citrus and curly hair is 5%, which is higher than the individual probability of citrus (11%) and lower than the individual probability of curly hair (16.5% - 67% of the absence of both citrus and curly hair). This suggests that citrus and curly hair are conditionally dependent, and the probability of curly hair is higher when citrus is consumed.||",
