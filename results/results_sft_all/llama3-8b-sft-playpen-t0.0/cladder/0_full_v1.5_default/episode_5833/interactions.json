The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of having a sister is 98%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 24%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 48%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the vast majority of the population (98%) has a sister, and among this large group, the probability of lung cancer is still only 48%. In contrast, the probability of lung cancer among those without a sister is 24%. Since the number of people without a sister is tiny compared to those with a sister, the overall probability of lung cancer is still lower than the probability of absence of lung cancer.||",
