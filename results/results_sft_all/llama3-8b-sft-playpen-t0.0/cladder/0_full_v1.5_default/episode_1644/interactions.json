The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of rainy season is 90%. For people in the dry season, the probability of wet ground is 57%. For in the rainy season, the probability of wet ground is 58%. Is wet ground less likely than dry ground overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the overall probability of a wet ground is a weighted average of the probability of a wet ground in the rainy season (58%) and the probability of a wet ground in the dry season (57%). Since the probability of a rainy season is higher than the probability of a dry season, the overall probability of a wet ground is likely to be higher than the probability of a dry ground.||",
