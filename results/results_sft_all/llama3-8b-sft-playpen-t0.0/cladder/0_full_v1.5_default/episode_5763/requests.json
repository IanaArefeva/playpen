The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 96%. The probability of nonsmoking and freckles is 2%. The probability of smoking and freckles is 65%. Is the chance of freckles smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of freckles is also directly related to the probability of not smoking, which is 4% (100% - 96% of the population smokes). Since the probability of freckles is 2% in the general population and 65% in the smoking subpopulation, we can conclude that the chance of freckles is larger when observing smoking, not smaller.<|eot_id|>",
