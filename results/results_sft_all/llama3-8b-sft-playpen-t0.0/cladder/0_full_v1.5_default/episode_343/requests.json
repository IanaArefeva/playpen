The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on skin. Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 5%. The probability of no tanning salon treatment and tanned skin is 40%. The probability of tanning salon treatment and tanned skin is 4%. Is the chance of tanned skin smaller when observing tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The difference in probability is 36% (40% - 4%). This difference is larger than the probability of tanning salon treatment (5%). This suggests that the chance of tanned skin is not smaller when observing tanning salon treatment, but rather that the tanning salon treatment is a strong predictor of tanned skin.<|eot_id|>",
