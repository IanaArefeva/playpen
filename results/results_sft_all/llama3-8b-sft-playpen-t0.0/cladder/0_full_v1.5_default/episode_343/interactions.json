The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on skin. Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 5%. The probability of no tanning salon treatment and tanned skin is 40%. The probability of tanning salon treatment and tanned skin is 4%. Is the chance of tanned skin smaller when observing tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This difference is larger than the probability of tanning salon treatment (5%). This suggests that the chance of tanned skin is not smaller when observing tanning salon treatment, but rather that the tanning salon treatment is a strong predictor of tanned skin.||",
