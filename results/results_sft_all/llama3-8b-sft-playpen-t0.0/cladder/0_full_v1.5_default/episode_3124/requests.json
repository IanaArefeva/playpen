The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active or high cigarette tax causes smoking mother. confounder active or smoking mother causes normal infant birth weight. We observed the cigarette tax is high and confounder inactive. Would the infant is born with low weight if nonsmoking mother instead of smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the confounder is active, it would still lead to a normal birth weight for the infant, even if the mother is a nonsmoker. The direct effect of the unobserved confounder on birth weight supersedes the effect of the mother's smoking status.<|eot_id|>",
