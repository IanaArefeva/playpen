The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 85%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 62%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 87%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 56%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 86%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 45%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 85%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 46%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 95%. Does gender positively affect admission status through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

First, the relationship between gender and department competitiveness is established, and then the relationship between department competitiveness and admission status is established. The direct relationship between gender and admission status is not fully accounted for by the relationship between gender and department competitiveness. The probability of admission acceptance for male and non-competitive department applicants is 87%, which is higher than the 85% probability for non-male and non-competitive department applicants. This difference in probability suggests that there is an additional direct effect of being male on admission status that is not fully accounted for by the relationship between being male and being in a competitive department.||",
