The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. We know that smoking causes high tar deposit, and we know that high tar deposit causes lung cancer. Would the person has no lung cancer if smoking instead of nonsmoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
