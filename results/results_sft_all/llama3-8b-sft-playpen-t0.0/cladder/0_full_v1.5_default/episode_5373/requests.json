The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 83%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 55%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 52%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 24%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 71%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 56%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 29%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 47%. The overall probability of confounder active is 42%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would parents' intelligence negatively affect lactose intolerance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being lactose intolerant is higher for children with unintelligent parents than for children with intelligent parents in both the high and low social status groups. This pattern does not support a direct negative effect of parents' intelligence on children's lactose intolerance.<|eot_id|>",
