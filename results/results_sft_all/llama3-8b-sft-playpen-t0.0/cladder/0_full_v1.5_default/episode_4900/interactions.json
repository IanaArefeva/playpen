The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on black hair. Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. Method 1: We look directly at how tanning salon treatment correlates with black hair in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to going to the beach. To understand how tanning salon treatment affects black hair, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because we need to account for the interaction between tanning salon treatment and beach activities when examining their joint effect on black hair. If we directly look at the general relationship between tanning salon treatment and black hair (Method 1), we might overlook the possibility that the beach activities could be mediating or confounding this relationship. For example, people who go to the beach might already have black hair, and the tanning salon treatment could still have an effect on their black hair. In this case, looking at the relationship case by case (Method 2) would allow us to control for the beach activities and more accurately estimate the direct effect of tanning salon treatment on black hair.||",
