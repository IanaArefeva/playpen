Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives treatment. large kidney stone or receives treatment causes recovery. We observed the patient has a large kidney stone.

This means that the patient's large kidney stone directly leads to them receiving treatment. The direct relationship between treatment and recovery is that treatment causes recovery. This means that if the patient were to receive treatment, it would directly lead to their recovery.<|eot_id|>",
