Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes vitamin C deficiency, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes no scurvy.

If citrus intake directly affects vitamin C, and if sufficient vitamin C directly counteracts scurvy, then citrus should reduce the risk of scurvy. If citrus instead of absence of citrus is present, it should still lead to higher levels of vitamin C, which in turn should reduce the risk of scurvy.<|eot_id|>",
