The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 62%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 91%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 19%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 49%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 62%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 38%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 94%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 58%. The overall probability of good health is 11%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would having a sister negatively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The table only provides the probability of high infant mortality for different subgroups of infants, which does not directly imply a negative effect of having a sister on infant's birth weight. In fact, the table shows that for infants who have a sister and normal birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 49%, which is lower than the probability of high infant mortality for infants who do not have a sister and normal birth weight (91%). This suggests that having a sister might have a positive effect on infant's birth weight, which in turn could lead to lower infant mortality.||",
