Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not listen to jazz and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 45%. For people who do not listen to jazz and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 89%. For people who listen to jazz and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For people who listen to jazz and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 75%. For people who do not listen to jazz and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 21%. For people who do not listen to jazz and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 47%. For people who listen to jazz and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 56%. For people who listen to jazz and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 83%. The overall probability of high pollution is 57%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would listening to jazz positively affect lung cancer?",
