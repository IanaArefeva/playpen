The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 33%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 88%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 20%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 20%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 55%. The overall probability of smoking is 52%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is higher than among nonsmokers, but this is primarily because the probability of high tar deposit is higher among smokers, which in turn increases the likelihood of lung cancer. In other words, the increase in lung cancer risk among smokers is primarily due to the higher probability of high tar deposit, rather than a direct effect of smoking on lung cancer.||",
