The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 55%. The probability of high school degree or lower and high salary is 21%. The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 5%. Is the chance of high salary smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of college degree or higher is 55%, and the probability of high school degree or lower and high salary is 21%. The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 5%. The key point is that the unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both education level and salary, which means that the relationship between college degree or higher and high salary is not fully causal. The observed relationship between college degree or higher and high salary is likely to be confounded by the unobserved confounders.||",
