The probability of not liking spicy food and having a high salary is 46%, and the probability of liking spicy food and having a high salary is 1%. The direct relationship between liking spicy food and occupation, and occupation and salary, means that the 1% chance of liking spicy food and having a high salary is not separate from the 46% chance of not liking spicy food and having a high salary; rather, the 1% chance is a direct result of the higher occupation associated with liking spicy food. This means that the chance of high salary is not smaller when observing liking spicy food; rather, the 1% chance of high salary when liking spicy food is a direct result of the higher occupation associated with liking spicy food, which in turn leads to a higher salary.<|eot_id|>",
