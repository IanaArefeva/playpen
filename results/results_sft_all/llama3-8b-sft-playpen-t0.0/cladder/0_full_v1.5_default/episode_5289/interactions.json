The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 3%. The probability of not liking spicy food and high salary is 46%. The probability of liking spicy food and high salary is 1%. Is the chance of high salary smaller when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of not liking spicy food and having a high salary is 46%, and the probability of liking spicy food and having a high salary is 1%. The direct relationship between liking spicy food and occupation, and occupation and salary, means that the 1% chance of liking spicy food and having a high salary is not separate from the 46% chance of not liking spicy food and having a high salary; rather, the 1% chance is a direct result of the higher occupation associated with liking spicy food. This means that the chance of high salary is not smaller when observing liking spicy food; rather, the 1% chance of high salary when liking spicy food is a direct result of the higher occupation associated with liking spicy food, which in turn leads to a higher salary.||",
