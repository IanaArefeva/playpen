The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of freckles is 37%. For individuals who are male, the probability of freckles is 68%. Will male gender increase the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, we must consider the additional direct relationship between department competitiveness and freckles. If male gender is associated with higher department competitiveness, and higher department competitiveness is associated with a higher probability of freckles, then the positive relationship between male gender and freckles could be spurious. In other words, the relationship between male gender and freckles might be fully explained by the intervening variable of department competitiveness.||",
