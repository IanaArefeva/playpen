The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 8%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 22%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 84%. The overall probability of male gender is 47%. For patients who have a brother, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of having a brother is higher for male patients, and male patients have a higher probability of recovery than female patients, we can conclude that the positive effect of having a brother on recovery is more likely to be associated with male patients. This suggests that the relationship between having a brother and recovery is not entirely independent of the patient's gender. In particular, the positive effect of having a brother on recovery is more likely to be associated with male patients, which means that the absence of a brother would not reduce the likelihood of recovery for male patients.||",
