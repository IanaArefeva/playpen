The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 80%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 3%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 57%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 18%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 59%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 22%. The overall probability of smoking is 75%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the given world, the probability of lung cancer is higher for both nonsmokers and smokers when there is no tar deposit (57% for nonsmokers and 59% for smokers) than when there is a high tar deposit (18% for nonsmokers and 22% for smokers). This suggests that the presence of a high tar deposit could reduce the risk of lung cancer for both groups. Since the probability of high tar deposit is 3% for smokers and 80% for nonsmokers, the overall risk of lung cancer is likely higher for nonsmokers than for smokers, given the higher probability of high tar deposit among nonsmokers.<|eot_id|>",
