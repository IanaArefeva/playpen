Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 38%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 60%. Will alarm set by husband increase the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm ringing is still primarily determined by the wife's action, which is not directly related to the husband's action of setting the alarm. The husband's action of setting the alarm only conditionally affects the probability of the alarm ringing, and does not directly increase the chance of the alarm ringing.<|eot_id|>",
