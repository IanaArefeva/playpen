Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 42%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 60%.

The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is also positive, as higher blood pressure likely leads to a higher risk of heart condition. Since having a sister directly affects heart condition and blood pressure directly affects heart condition, we can conclude that having a sister will not decrease the chance of a healthy heart.<|eot_id|>",
