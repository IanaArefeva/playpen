The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 54%. For children who do not like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 26%. For children who like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 79%. For children who like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 51%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 37%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 46%. For children who like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 76%. For children who like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 85%. The overall probability of confounder active is 48%. Does liking spicy food positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
