The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 18%. The probability of not taking medication and healthy heart is 55%. The probability of taking medication and healthy heart is 8%. Is the chance of healthy heart smaller when observing taking medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is that higher blood pressure leads to a higher probability of heart condition. Since the probability of taking medication is 18%, and the probability of taking medication and having a healthy heart is 8%, we can conclude that the chance of having a healthy heart is lower when not taking medication.<|eot_id|>",
