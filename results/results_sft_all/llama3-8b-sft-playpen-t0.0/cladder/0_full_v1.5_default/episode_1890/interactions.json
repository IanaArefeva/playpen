The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 18%. The probability of not taking medication and healthy heart is 55%. The probability of taking medication and healthy heart is 8%. Is the chance of healthy heart smaller when observing taking medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is that higher blood pressure leads to a higher probability of heart condition. Since the probability of taking medication is 18%, and the probability of taking medication and having a healthy heart is 8%, we can conclude that the chance of having a healthy heart is lower when not taking medication.||",
