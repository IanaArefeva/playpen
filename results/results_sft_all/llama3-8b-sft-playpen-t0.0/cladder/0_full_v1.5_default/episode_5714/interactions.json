The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 62%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 91%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 19%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 49%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 62%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 38%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 94%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 58%. The overall probability of good health is 11%. Does having a sister positively affect infant mortality through infant's birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between having a sister and infant's birth weight is not clear from the given information. The probability of normal birth weight for those with a sister and with good health is 58%, which is lower than the 62% for those without a sister and with good health. This suggests that having a sister might not directly reduce the risk of normal birth weight. The positive effect of having a sister on birth weight is not clear from the given data, and the direct relationship between having a sister and birth weight is not established.||",
