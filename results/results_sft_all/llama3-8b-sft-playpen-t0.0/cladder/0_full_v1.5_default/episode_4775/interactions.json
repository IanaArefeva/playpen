The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on rainfall. Sprinkler has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of rainy season is 90%. The probability of dry season and high rainfall is 6%. The probability of rainy season and high rainfall is 53%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing rainy season?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of high rainfall is already higher in the rainy season (53%) than in the dry season (6%), the additional direct relationship between the weather and the sprinkler does not change the overall probability of high rainfall in the rainy season. The direct relationship between the weather and the sprinkler primarily affects the probability of high rainfall in the dry season, not in the rainy season.||",
