Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 67%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 55%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between effort and college admission is that higher effort leads to higher college admission probability. Since the student is a smoker, we already know that their college admission probability is lower than that of a nonsmoker. The additional information that the student exerts more effort than a typical smoker does not change the direct relationship between smoking and college admission. The higher effort of the smoker still doesn't bring their college admission probability up to the 67% level of a typical nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
