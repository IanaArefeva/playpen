The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 35%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 67%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 34%. Is normal infant birth weight more likely than low infant birth weight overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The unobserved confounder U has a direct effect on both maternal smoking and birth weight, which means U could plausibly lead to lower birth weight in children of smoking mothers, further decreasing the probability of normal birth weight in this group. The cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking, which could reduce the number of children born to smoking mothers, but this does not directly impact the birth weight of children. The overall probability of normal birth weight is lower than that of low birth weight, which can be seen by looking at the specific probabilities: 34% for normal birth weight among children of smoking mothers and 66% for normal birth weight among children of nonsmoking mothers, which still doesn't bring the overall probability of normal birth weight above 50%.||",
