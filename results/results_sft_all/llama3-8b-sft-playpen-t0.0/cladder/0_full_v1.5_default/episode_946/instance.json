  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 96%. For normal weight people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 54%. For obese people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 92%. For obese people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 60%. For normal weight people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 25%. For normal weight people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 55%. For obese people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 59%. For obese people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 80%. The overall probability of smoker is 18%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would obesity negatively affect lifespan?",
