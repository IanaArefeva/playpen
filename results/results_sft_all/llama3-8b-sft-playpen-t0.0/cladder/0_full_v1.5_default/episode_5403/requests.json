Effort has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of smoking is 83%. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 51%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 37%.

Additionally, the direct relationship between effort and freckles is that higher effort is associated with a higher probability of freckles. Since the probability of smoking is 83%, the large majority of the population is smokers, and among them, the probability of freckles is lower than among nonsmokers. This suggests that the overall probability of freckles is likely to be lower than the probability of no freckles, given the higher base rate of smoking and the lower probability of freckles among smokers.<|eot_id|>",
