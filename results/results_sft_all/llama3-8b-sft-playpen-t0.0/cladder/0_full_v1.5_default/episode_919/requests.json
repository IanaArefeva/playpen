The direct relationship between effort and college admission is that higher effort leads to higher college admission rates. Since the question is about the counterfactual scenario of a smoker being a nonsmoker, we need to consider the chain of cause and effect. If a smoker were a nonsmoker, their college admission probability would still be 79% (the probability for nonsmokers), not higher than the 48% probability for smokers. This is because the direct effect of being a nonsmoker on college admission is separate from the direct effect of being a smoker on college admission. The chain of cause and effect is: being a smoker affects college admission, and being a nonsmoker affects college admission, but there is no direct link between being a smoker and being a nonsmoker that would change the college admission probability.<|eot_id|>",
