The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 28%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 66%. For students who are encouraged, would it be less likely to see high exam score if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of studying habits on exam score is also positive, meaning that higher studying habits lead to higher exam scores. Since encouragement directly affects exam score and studying habits are also directly related to exam score, we can conclude that encouragement will lead to higher exam scores, which in turn lead to higher exam habits. In this case, the positive direct effect of encouragement on exam score supersedes any potential negative indirect effect through studying habits.<|eot_id|>",
