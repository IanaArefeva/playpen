Effort has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of smoking is 93%. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 44%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 66%. Is freckles more likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between effort and freckles is that higher effort is associated with higher probability of freckles. The direct relationship between smoking and effort is that smoking is associated with lower effort. Since the probability of smoking is 93%, the overall probability of freckles is primarily determined by the relationship between smoking and freckles. In this case, the higher probability of freckles among smokers (66%) compared to nonsmokers (44%) means that the overall probability of freckles is lower than the probability of no freckles.<|eot_id|>",
