The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how smoking correlates with freckles in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to gender. To understand how smoking affects freckles, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we have a direct relationship between two variables (smoking and freckles) that is not the same across subgroups, we should control for the unobserved variable (gender) to get an accurate picture of the relationship between the two. Method 1 does not account for this difference in subgroups and is likely to produce a biased result. In this case, looking at the relationship case by case according to gender (Method 2) is more correct, as it controls for the unobserved variable and provides a more accurate picture of the relationship between smoking and freckles.||",
