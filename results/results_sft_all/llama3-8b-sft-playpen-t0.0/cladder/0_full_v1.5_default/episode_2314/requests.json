The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 91%. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 44%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 60%. Is long lifespan more likely than short lifespan overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of long lifespan is higher for obese than for normal weight people, and the direct relationship between obesity and long lifespan is positive, we can conclude that long lifespan is more likely than short lifespan for the general population.<|eot_id|>",
