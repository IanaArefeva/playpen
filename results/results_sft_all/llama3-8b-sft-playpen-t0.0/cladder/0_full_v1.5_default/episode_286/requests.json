The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 53%. The probability of waking up on time and arriving to school on time is 35%. The probability of waking up late and arriving to school on time is 20%. Is the chance of arriving to school on time smaller when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of both waking up late and arriving to school on time is 20%. This means that 20% of the time, Alice wakes up late and still manages to arrive on time, which is a separate condition from the direct relationship between waking up and arriving to school. The direct relationship between waking up and arriving to school is separate from the condition of being late, and the probability of arriving on time is not directly affected by the condition of being late.<|eot_id|>",
