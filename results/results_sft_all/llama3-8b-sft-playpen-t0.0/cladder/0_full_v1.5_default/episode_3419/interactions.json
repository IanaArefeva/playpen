The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 30%. The probability of not liking spicy food and the forest on fire is 37%. The probability of liking spicy food and the forest on fire is 26%. Is the chance of the forest on fire smaller when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the forest on fire given that the person likes spicy food is 26%, which is higher than the overall probability of the forest on fire (26%  16.5%). This suggests that the direct effect of liking spicy food on the forest is positive, meaning that the forest is more likely to be on fire when the person likes spicy food.||",
