Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 12%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 23%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 87%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 99%. The overall probability of old age is 45%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?",
