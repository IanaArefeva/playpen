The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 41%. For people who do not play card games and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 61%. For people who play card games and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 63%. For people who play card games and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 86%. For people who do not play card games and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 84%. For people who do not play card games and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 60%. For people who play card games and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 56%. For people who play card games and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 25%. The overall probability of smoker is 95%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would playing card games negatively affect lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
