The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 68%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 37%. Will speaking english increase the chance of long lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only direct relationship we have is that diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Since we do not have any direct relationship between speaking English and diabetes, we need to consider the relationships through other variables. The probability of long lifespan is higher for those who do not speak English (68%) than for those who speak English (37%). This suggests that the direct or indirect effect of speaking English on long lifespan is negative.||",
