  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 96%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 74%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 24%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 2%. The overall probability of old age is 40%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be more likely to see thick lips if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?",
