The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. Method 1: We look directly at how eating citrus correlates with curly hair in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to vitmain C. To understand how eating citrus affects curly hair, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If we directly look at the correlation between eating citrus and curly hair (Method 1), we risk confounding the relationship with the direct effect of vitmain C on both variables. By examining the relationship case by case according to vitmain C (Method 2), we can control for this intervening variable and more accurately identify the direct effect of eating citrus on curly hair.||",
