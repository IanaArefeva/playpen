Brown eyes has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between talent and brown eyes is -0.06.

The negative correlation between talent and brown eyes among students accepted to elite institutions does not indicate that talent affects brown eyes; rather, it might indicate that both brown eyes and talent are associated with lower likelihood of being accepted to an elite institution, or that there is a third variable that affects both brown eyes and talent.<|eot_id|>",
