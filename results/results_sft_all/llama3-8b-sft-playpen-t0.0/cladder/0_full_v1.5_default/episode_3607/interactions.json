The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. Method 1: We look at how having a sister correlates with heart condition case by case according to blood pressure. Method 2: We look directly at how having a sister correlates with heart condition in general. To understand how having a sister affects heart condition, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition, and blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. In this case, looking at the relationship between having a sister and heart condition through the intermediate variable of blood pressure (Method 1) is more appropriate than looking at the direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition (Method 2). This is because the direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition is confounded by the effect of blood pressure, which is a direct cause of heart condition. By controlling for blood pressure, we can more accurately estimate the effect of having a sister on heart condition.||",
