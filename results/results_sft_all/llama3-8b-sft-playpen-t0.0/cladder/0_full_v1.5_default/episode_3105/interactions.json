The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. We know that smoking gene and high pollution causes smoking. smoking gene and high pollution and smoking causes lung cancer. We observed the person lives in a place with low pollution. Would the person has lung cancer if nonsmoking gene instead of smoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we know that the person lives in a place with low pollution, we can conclude that the person's lung cancer is likely due to the smoking gene rather than the interaction between the smoking gene and high pollution. If the person had a nonsmoking gene, we would still need to consider the possibility of the person being exposed to high pollution, which could lead to lung cancer. Since we do not have information about the person's individual risk of being exposed to high pollution, we cannot conclude that the person would not have lung cancer if they had a nonsmoking gene.||",
