The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 82%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 53%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 66%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 32%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the probability of lung cancer for a smoker is more likely to be associated with the condition of having no tar deposit than with the condition of having high tar deposit. Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for a smoker with no tar deposit than for a smoker with high tar deposit, it is not less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker.||",
