The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 24%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 48%. Will having a sister increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between having a sister and lung cancer is likely being confounded by the relationship between having a sister and the probability of having a higher tar deposit. In this world, having a sister is associated with a higher probability of having a higher tar deposit, which in turn is associated with a higher probability of lung cancer. If we control for the level of tar deposit, we would likely find that having a sister does not directly increase the chance of lung cancer.||",
