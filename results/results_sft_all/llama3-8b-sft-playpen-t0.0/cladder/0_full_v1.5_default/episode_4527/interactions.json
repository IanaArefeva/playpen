The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and brown eyes. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on brown eyes. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how maternal smoking status correlates with brown eyes in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to unobserved confounders. To understand how maternal smoking status affects brown eyes, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is exactly the situation where looking at the relationship case by case (Method 2) is more appropriate, as it can help control for the unobserved confounders and reveal the true causal relationship between maternal smoking status and brown eyes.||",
