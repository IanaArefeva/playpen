The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 82%. For students who are not talented and rejected from elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 99%. For students who are not talented and accepted to elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 82%. For students who are talented and rejected from elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 96%. For students who are talented and accepted to elite institutions, the probability of being hard-working is 53%. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does the chance of being hard-working decrease when talent?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
