The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 14%. The probability of unintelligent parents and being lactose intolerant is 49%. The probability of intelligent parents and being lactose intolerant is 5%. Is the chance of being lactose intolerant larger when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is because the chain of direct relationships from intelligence to social status to lactose intolerance means that the condition of being intelligent parents directly affects the likelihood of being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
