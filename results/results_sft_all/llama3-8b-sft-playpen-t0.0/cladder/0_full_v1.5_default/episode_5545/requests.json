The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on full moon and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on full moon. Full moon has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of full moon is 66%. The probability of no full moon and increased price is 29%. The probability of full moon and increased price is 40%. Is the chance of increased price larger when observing full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of full moon is 66%, the probability of no full moon is 34%. The probability of no full moon and increased price is 29%, which is less than the probability of full moon and increased price (40%). This suggests that the chance of increased price is larger when not observing full moon.<|eot_id|>",
