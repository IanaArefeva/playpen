Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not listen to jazz and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 35%. For people who do not listen to jazz and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For people who listen to jazz and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 35%. For people who listen to jazz and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 66%. For people who do not listen to jazz and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 29%. For people who do not listen to jazz and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 58%. For people who listen to jazz and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 64%. For people who listen to jazz and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 84%. The overall probability of high pollution is 56%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would listening to jazz positively affect lung cancer?",
