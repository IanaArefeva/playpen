The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 46%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 21%. For infants with smoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 74%. For infants with smoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 47%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 51%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 72%. For infants with smoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 3%. For infants with smoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 35%. The overall probability of good health is 90%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would maternal smoking status negatively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In fact, the probability of high infant mortality is higher for infants with smoking mothers than for those with nonsmoking mothers in every condition. This suggests that maternal smoking has a positive direct effect on infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
