The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 38%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 80%. For people taking medication, would it be less likely to see healthy heart if the person had taken no medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of blood pressure on heart condition is also positive, meaning that higher blood pressure is associated with a lower probability of a healthy heart. Since the person is taking medication, we already know that their heart condition is likely to be healthy (80% probability). The blood pressure condition is not directly relevant to the heart condition in this case, as the medication is the primary factor influencing the heart condition. Therefore, it is not less likely to see a healthy heart if the person had taken no medication, as the medication is the primary driver of the heart condition in this scenario.||",
