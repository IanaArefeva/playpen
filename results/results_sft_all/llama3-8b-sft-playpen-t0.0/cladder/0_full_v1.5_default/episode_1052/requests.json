The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 4%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 25%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 76%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 97%. The overall probability of male gender is 43%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If Will is male, then the probability of his recovery is 76%. If Will is not male, then the probability of his recovery is 4%. In both scenarios, the probability of Will's recovery is less than 97%, which is the probability of male patients who are also receiving treatment. Since the probability of Will's male gender is 43%, we can conclude that the probability of Will's recovery is less than 97%.<|eot_id|>",
