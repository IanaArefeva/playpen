The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 49%. The probability of nonsmoking and being allergic to peanuts is 16%. The probability of smoking and being allergic to peanuts is 24%. Is the chance of being allergic to peanuts larger when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between smoking and tar deposit is also a direct one, and the relationship between tar deposit and peanut allergy is direct as well. This means that the effect of smoking on peanut allergy is not direct, but rather is mediated by the intervening variable of tar deposit. In other words, the relationship between smoking and peanut allergy is not a direct one, but rather is a two-step process: first, smoking leads to a higher chance of having a higher tar deposit, and then a higher chance of having a higher tar deposit leads to a higher chance of being allergic to peanuts. The key point here is that the direct relationship between smoking and peanut allergy is not the only one at play, and that the intervening variable of tar deposit must be taken into account when assessing the relationship between smoking and peanut allergy.||",
