Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of black hair is 58%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of black hair is 18%. Will tanning salon treatment increase the chance of black hair?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This indicates that tanning salon treatment has a negative causal relationship with black hair. The direct effect of going to the beach on black hair is also a reduction in the probability of black hair, which further solidifies the negative relationship between tanning salon treatment and black hair.<|eot_id|>",
