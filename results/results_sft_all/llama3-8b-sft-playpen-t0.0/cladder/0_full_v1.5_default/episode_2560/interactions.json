The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 81%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 85%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 65%. Is high infant mortality less likely than low infant mortality overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of high infant mortality is lower for infants with smoking mothers than for those with nonsmoking mothers, this suggests that the positive effect of lower birth weight on higher infant mortality is counterbalanced by the negative effect of maternal smoking on birth weight. The overall probability of high infant mortality is lower than that of low infant mortality, which is 15% (1 - 0.85), than the probability of high infant mortality for nonsmoking mothers, which is 85%.||",
