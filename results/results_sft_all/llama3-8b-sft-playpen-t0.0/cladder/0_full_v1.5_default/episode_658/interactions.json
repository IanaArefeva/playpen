The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 27%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 52%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 47%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 82%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 31%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 57%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would encouragement level negatively affect exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This positive relationship between encouragement and exam score directly counters the idea that encouragement would negatively affect exam score.||",
