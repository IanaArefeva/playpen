The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of speaking english is 13%. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 38%. Is long lifespan less likely than short lifespan overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is also negative. Since the probability of long lifespan is higher for those who do not speak English than for those who speak English, and we have a direct negative relationship between diabetes and long lifespan, we can conclude that the overall probability of long lifespan is less likely than short lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
