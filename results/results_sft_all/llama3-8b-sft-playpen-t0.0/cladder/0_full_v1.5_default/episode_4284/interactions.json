The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 11%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 22%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 86%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 98%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 56%. For people getting the vaccine, would it be more likely to see being lactose intolerant if the person had not refused the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the vaccine has a protective effect against lactose intolerance in this group. In the subpopulation with pre-conditions, the probability of being lactose intolerant is higher for both those who get the vaccine (98%) and those who refuse the vaccine (86%). The key difference is that the vaccine does not reduce the risk of being lactose intolerant in this subpopulation; rather, it appears to increase the risk. Since the overall probability of pre-conditions is 56%, we can conclude that the vaccine would make it more likely to see being lactose intolerant if the person had not refused the vaccine.||",
