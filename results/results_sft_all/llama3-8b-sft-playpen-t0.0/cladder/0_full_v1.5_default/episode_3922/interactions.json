The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 8%. For individuals who have not visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 41%. For individuals who have visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 8%. For individuals who have visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 47%. For individuals who have not visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 27%. For individuals who have not visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 56%. For individuals who have visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 48%. For individuals who have visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 81%. The overall probability of high skill level is 18%. If we disregard the mediation effect through occupation, would having visited England positively affect salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The table only shows the probability of high salary for different subgroups, but it does not provide explicit information about the direct effect of having visited England on salary. To conclude that having visited England would have a positive effect on salary, we would need more explicit information about this direct relationship.||",
