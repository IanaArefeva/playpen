The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of high salary is 31%. For individuals who are male, the probability of high salary is 65%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see high salary if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The occupation also has a direct effect on salary, and the skill level is unobserved. Since the skill is unobserved, we can't conclude that being male directly affects the probability of having a high salary. The difference in the probability of having a high salary between male and non-male individuals might be due to the differences in occupation rather than being male per se.||",
