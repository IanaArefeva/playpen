Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 5%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 42%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 90%.

The direct effect of going to the beach on foot size is that it also leads to a higher probability of large feet. Since both tanning salon treatment and beach activities lead to larger foot size, we need to consider the joint effect of these two treatments on foot size. The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments is 90%, and the probability of large feet among those who went to the beach is also 90%. The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments and also went to the beach is 90%. The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments but did not go to the beach is 90%. The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments and also went to the beach is 90%. The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments but did not go to the beach is 90%.
