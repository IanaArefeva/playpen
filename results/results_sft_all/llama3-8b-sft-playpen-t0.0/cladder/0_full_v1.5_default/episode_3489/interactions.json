The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 5%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 42%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 90%. Is large feet less likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of going to the beach on foot size is that it also leads to a higher probability of large feet. Since both tanning salon treatment and beach activities lead to larger foot size, we need to consider the joint effect of these two treatments on foot size. The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments is 90%, and the probability of large feet among those who went to the beach is also 90%. The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments and also went to the beach is 90%. The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments but did not go to the beach is 90%. The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments and also went to the beach is 90%.
