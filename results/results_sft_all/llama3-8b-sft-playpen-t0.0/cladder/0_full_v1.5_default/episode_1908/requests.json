The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 91%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 84%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 84%. Is talent less likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being unattractive is 9% and the probability of being attractive is 91%, the overall probability of having talent is a weighted average of the two groups, which is still 84%. This is because the 9% of unattractive people with a 84% chance of having talent do not change the overall probability of having talent, which remains the same as the 91% of attractive people with an 84% chance of having talent.<|eot_id|>",
