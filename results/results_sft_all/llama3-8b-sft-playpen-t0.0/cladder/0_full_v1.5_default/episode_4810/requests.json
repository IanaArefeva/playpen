The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. For people who do not speak english, the probability of the forest on fire is 69%. For people who speak english, the probability of the forest on fire is 52%.

The probability of the forest on fire is higher for those who do not speak English (69%) than for those who speak English (52%). This suggests that the ability to speak English might reduce the chance of the forest on fire, rather than increase it.<|eot_id|>",
