The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 13%. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 37%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 45%. Is black hair less likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of black hair is 45% for those with a college degree or higher, which is higher than the 37% probability for those without a college degree. This indicates that black hair is more likely than not in this population, and since the probability of college degree or higher is 13%, the overall probability of black hair is still higher than the probability of college degree or higher.||",
