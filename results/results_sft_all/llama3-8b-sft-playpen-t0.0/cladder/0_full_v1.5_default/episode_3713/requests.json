The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 42%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 63%. Does education level positively affect black hair through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of black hair among those with a college degree or higher is higher than among those without a college degree, which might imply a direct positive effect of education on black hair. The intervening role of skill is not sufficient to account for this difference, as the probability of black hair among those with a college degree or higher is still higher than among those without a college degree, even after controlling for skill.<|eot_id|>",
