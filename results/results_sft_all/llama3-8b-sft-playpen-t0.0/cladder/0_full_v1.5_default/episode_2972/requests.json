The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that intelligent parents and confounder active causes high parental social status. intelligent parents or confounder active or high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder active. Would the child is intelligent if unintelligent parents instead of intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that intelligent parents and the active confounder both lead to high parental social status, and that this high social status in turn leads to intelligent children, we can conclude that the child will still be intelligent if we consider the active confounder as the primary cause of high social status, rather than the parents' intelligence. This is because the active confounder is already active, and its effect on child's intelligence is not dependent on the parents' intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
