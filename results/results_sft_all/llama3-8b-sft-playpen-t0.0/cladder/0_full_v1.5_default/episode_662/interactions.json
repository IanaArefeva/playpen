The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 32%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 56%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 53%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 86%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 10%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 85%. Does encouragement level negatively affect exam score through studying habit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The exam score is higher for those who are both encouraged and study hard (86%) than for those who are not encouraged and study hard (56%). This indicates that encouragement has a direct positive effect on exam score, rather than a negative effect through studying habits.||",
