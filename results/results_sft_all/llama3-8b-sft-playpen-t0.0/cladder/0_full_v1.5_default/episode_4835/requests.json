The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of speaking english is 98%. The probability of not speaking english and the forest on fire is 2%. The probability of speaking english and the forest on fire is 46%. Is the chance of the forest on fire larger when observing speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the forest on fire is 2% when not speaking English, and 46% when speaking English. The difference in probability is 44%, which is a clear indication that the forest is more likely to be on fire when not speaking English.<|eot_id|>",
