Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 49%. The probability of vaccine refusal and recovering from the disease is 20%. The probability of getting the vaccine and recovering from the disease is 34%. Is the chance of recovering from the disease larger when observing getting the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
