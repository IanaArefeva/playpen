The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how maternal smoking status correlates with freckles in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to infant's birth weight. To understand how maternal smoking status affects freckles, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the direct relationship between maternal smoking and freckles is not what we want to study; rather, we want to study the relationship between health condition and freckles, which is then influenced by maternal smoking. Method 1 looks at the direct relationship between maternal smoking and freckles, which is not the correct focus. Method 2, on the other hand, looks at the relationship between maternal smoking and freckles conditionally on the birth weight, which is a more appropriate focus since birth weight is a mediator of the relationship between health condition and freckles.||",
