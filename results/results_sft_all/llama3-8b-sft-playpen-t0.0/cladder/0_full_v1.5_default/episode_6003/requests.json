Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that solar eclipse or heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is no traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school late if no solar eclipse instead of solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we are given that there is no traffic on the road, the direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is the only active cause in this scenario. If there is no solar eclipse, the direct cause of Alice's late arrival is removed, and the absence of solar eclipse does not directly lead to a late arrival.<|eot_id|>",
