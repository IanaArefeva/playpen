The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 64%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 76%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 49%. Is increased price more likely than reduced price overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effects are as follows: demand affects both supply and price, yield per acre affects supply, and supply affects price. The unobserved demand has a direct effect on both supply and price.\nGiven that demand is unobserved, we must condition on the observed variables to make inferences about the relationships between them. The probability of an event (e.g., an increase in price) can be conditionally dependent on another event (e.g., an increase in demand) that is not directly observable.\nThe probability of an increase in demand is not directly given, but we can still condition on the observed relationships to make inferences. The probability of an increase in demand is not directly given, but we can still condition on the observed relationships to make inferences.\nThe probability of an increase in demand is not directly given, but we can still condition on the observed relationships to make inferences.
