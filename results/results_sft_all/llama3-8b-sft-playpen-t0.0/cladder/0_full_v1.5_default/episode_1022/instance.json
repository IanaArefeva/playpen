Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 64%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 76%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 49%. Is increased price more likely than reduced price overall?",
