The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how gender correlates with brown eyes case by case according to department competitiveness. Method 2: We look directly at how gender correlates with brown eyes in general. To understand how gender affects brown eyes, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In other words, the direct relationship between B and C means that B is not exogenous to C, and C is not exogenous to B. This means that we need to control for C when looking at the relationship between B and any other variable, including G. In this case, looking at the relationship between B and G in general (Method 2) is not sufficient to account for the direct relationship between B and C, and we need to consider the relationship between B and G within each level of C (Method 1) to get an accurate picture of how G affects B.<|eot_id|>",
