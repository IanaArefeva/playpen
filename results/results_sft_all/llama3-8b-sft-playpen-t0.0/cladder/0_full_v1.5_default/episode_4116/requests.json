Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 82%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 37%. Will citrus intake decrease the chance of curly hair?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key point here is that the probability of curly hair is higher (82%) for patients not consuming citrus compared to those who consume citrus (37%). This suggests that citrus consumption actually reduces the chance of curly hair, rather than increasing it. The direct effects of citrus on vitamin C and of vitamin C on curly hair do not change the fact that citrus consumption leads to a lower probability of curly hair.<|eot_id|>",
