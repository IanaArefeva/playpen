The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 20%. The probability of not having a sister and low cholesterol is 65%. The probability of having a sister and low cholesterol is 14%. Is the chance of low cholesterol larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having a sister is 20%, and the probability of having a sister and low cholesterol is 14%. This suggests that the joint probability of having a sister and having low cholesterol is less than the probability of having a sister, which is 20%. This indicates that the chance of having a sister is not associated with a lower chance of having high cholesterol, and in fact, the opposite is true.||",
