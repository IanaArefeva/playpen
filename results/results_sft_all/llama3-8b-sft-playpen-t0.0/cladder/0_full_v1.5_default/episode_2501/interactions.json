The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 63%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 25%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 62%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of not receiving treatment is 37% (100% - 63%), we can calculate the overall probability of recovery as follows:\n(0.37 * 0.25) + (0.63 * 0.62) = 0.0925 + 0.3914 = 0.484\nThe probability of non-recovery is 1 - 0.484 = 0.516\nSince 0.484 is less than 0.516, we conclude that non-recovery is more likely than recovery overall.||",
