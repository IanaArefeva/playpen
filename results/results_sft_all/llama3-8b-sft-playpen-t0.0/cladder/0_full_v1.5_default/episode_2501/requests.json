Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 63%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 25%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 62%.

Since the probability of not receiving treatment is 37% (100% - 63%), we can calculate the overall probability of recovery as follows:\n(0.37 * 0.25) + (0.63 * 0.62) = 0.0925 + 0.3914 = 0.484\nThe probability of non-recovery is 1 - 0.484 = 0.516\nSince 0.484 is less than 0.516, we conclude that non-recovery is more likely than recovery overall.<|eot_id|>",
