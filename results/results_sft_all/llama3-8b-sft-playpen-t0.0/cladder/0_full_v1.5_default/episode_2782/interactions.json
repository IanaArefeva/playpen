The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of clean water is 13%. For people with only polluted water, the probability of cholera contraction is 58%. For people with access to clean water, the probability of cholera contraction is 95%. Is cholera contraction more likely than cholera prevention overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that a large fraction of the population (87%) has clean water and a high risk of cholera. In contrast, the probability of cholera prevention is the same as the probability of clean water, which is 13%. Since the fraction of the population with clean water is larger than the fraction with clean water and no cholera, the overall probability of cholera contraction is higher than the probability of cholera prevention.||",
