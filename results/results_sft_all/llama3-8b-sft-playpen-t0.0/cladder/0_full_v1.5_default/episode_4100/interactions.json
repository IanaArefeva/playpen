The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 91%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 75%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 40%. Is curly hair more likely than straight hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the overall probability of having curly hair is a weighted average of the probability of having curly hair when citrus is consumed (40%) and the probability of having curly hair when citrus is not consumed (75%). The weightage is determined by the probability of citrus consumption (91%) and the probability of not consuming citrus (9%). The overall probability of having curly hair is then (0.91 * 0.4) + (0.09 * 0.75) = 0.3595 + 0.0675 = 0.427. The probability of having straight hair is then 1 - 0.427 = 0.573. Since 0.427 is less than 0.573, we conclude that straight hair is more likely than curly hair overall.||",
