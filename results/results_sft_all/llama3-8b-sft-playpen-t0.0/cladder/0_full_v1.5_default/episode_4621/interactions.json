The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 89%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 57%.
