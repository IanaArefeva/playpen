The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 34%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 28%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 64%. Is employee being fired less likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 28%. The probability of the manager signing the termination letter is 34%. In this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 64%. To find the overall probability of the employee being fired, we need to consider both scenarios. The overall probability of the manager not signing the letter is 66%, and in this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 28%. The overall probability of the manager signing the letter is 34%, and in this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 64%. The overall probability of the employee being fired is (0.66 * 0.28) + (0.34 * 0.64) = 0.1848 + 0.21504 = 0.39984. The probability of the employee not being fired is 1 - 0.39984 = 0.60016. Since 0.60016 is greater than 0.39984, the probability of the employee not being fired is higher than the probability of the employee being fired.<|eot_id|>",
