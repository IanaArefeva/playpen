The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 34%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 28%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 64%. Is employee being fired less likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the manager signing the termination letter is 34%. In this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 64%. To find the overall probability of the employee being fired, we need to consider both scenarios. The overall probability of the manager not signing the letter is 66%, and in this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 28%. The overall probability of the manager signing the letter is 34%, and in this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 64%. The overall probability of the employee being fired is (0.66 * 0.28) + (0.34 * 0.64) = 0.1848 + 0.21504 = 0.39984. The probability of the employee not being fired is 1 - 0.39984 = 0.60016. Since 0.60016 is greater than 0.39984, the probability of the employee not being fired is higher than the probability of the employee being fired.||",
