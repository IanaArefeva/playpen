The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes sufficient vitamin C, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes no scurvy. Would the patient has scurvy if absence of citrus instead of citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
