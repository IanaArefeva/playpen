The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 40%. For people who have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 74%. Does having a sister positively affect prisoner through the corporal and the private?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This difference in probability directly indicates that having a sister has a positive effect on the probability of the prisoner's death. The additional information about the direct relationships between the corporal and the private, and the private and the prisoner, does not change this conclusion. The direct relationship between having a sister and the probability of the prisoner's death is the key piece of information here, and it shows that having a sister has a positive effect on the probability of the prisoner's death.<|eot_id|>",
