Additionally, we have the condition that high poverty or a global water company cause clean water. Since the person is already being served by a global water company, this condition is already met, and we can conclude that the person has clean water. The condition \"high poverty and clean water cause cholera contraction\" is not directly relevant here, as we already know the person has clean water. The key point is that the person is being served by a global water company, which directly affects water quality, and we have established that this company's service leads to clean water.<|eot_id|>",
