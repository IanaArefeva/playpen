The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 68%. The probability of not blowing out the candle and dark room is 12%. The probability of blowing out the candle and dark room is 51%. Is the chance of dark room smaller when observing blowing out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of dark room is 51% when the candle is blown out and 12% when the candle is not blown out, which are different from the probability of the event of the candle being blown out (68%).<|eot_id|>",
