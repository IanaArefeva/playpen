The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on rainfall. Sprinkler has a direct effect on rainfall. For people in the dry season, the probability of high rainfall is 54%. For in the rainy season, the probability of high rainfall is 43%. Does season positively affect rainfall through weather and sprinkler?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
