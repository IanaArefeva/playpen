The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 55%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 18%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 61%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If the manager signs the letter, the probability of the employee being fired is 61%, and if the manager doesn't sign the letter, the probability of the employee being fired is 18%. To find the overall probability of the employee being fired, we need to consider both scenarios. The probability of the manager signing the letter and the employee being fired is 0.55 * 0.61 = 0.3355. The probability of the manager not signing the letter and the employee being fired is 0.45 * 0.18 = 0.0815. The total probability of the employee being fired is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.3355 + 0.0815 = 0.417. The probability of the manager not signing the letter and the employee not being fired is 0.45 * (1 - 0.18) = 0.45 * 0.82 = 0.369. The total probability of the employee not being fired is the sum of the probability of the manager not signing the letter and the employee being fired and the probability of the manager not signing the letter and the employee not being fired: 0.417 + 0.369 = 0.786.
