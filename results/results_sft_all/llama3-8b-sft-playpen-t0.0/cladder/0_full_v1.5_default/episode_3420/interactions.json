The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 24%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 34%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 60%. Is the forest on fire more likely than the forest not on fire overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since 24% of the population likes spicy food and 76% does not, we can weight the probabilities by the fraction of the population that likes and does not like spicy food. The probability of the forest being on fire is then (0.24 * 0.60) + (0.76 * 0.34) = 0.144 + 0.2592 = 0.4032, and the probability of the forest not being on fire is (0.24 * 0.40) + (0.76 * 0.66) = 0.096 + 0.5016 = 0.5976. Since 0.4032 is less than 0.5976, the forest is more likely than not to be on fire overall.||",
