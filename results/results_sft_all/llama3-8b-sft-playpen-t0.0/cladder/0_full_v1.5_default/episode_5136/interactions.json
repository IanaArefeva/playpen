The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 47%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The difference in probability is 22% (32% - 10%). This difference is not a direct measure of the effect of college degree or higher on large feet, as it also depends on the joint probability of large feet and college degree or higher. To conclude that the chance of large feet is smaller when observing college degree or higher, we need to consider the joint probability of large feet and college degree or higher, which is 10%. If we condition on college degree or higher, the probability of large feet is 10% (10% of 47% is 4.7%, which is less than 32%). This suggests that the chance of large feet is indeed smaller when observing college degree or higher.||",
