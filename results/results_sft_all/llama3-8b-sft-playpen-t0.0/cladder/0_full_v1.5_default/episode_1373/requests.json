Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 14%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being a smoker is 14%, and the probability of being a nonsmoker is 86% (100% - 14%). The probability of lung cancer among smokers is 52%, and the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers is 40%. The overall probability of lung cancer is (0.14 * 0.52) + (0.86 * 0.40) = 0.0692 + 0.344 = 0.4132. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.4132 = 0.5868. Since 0.5868 is greater than 0.4132, lung cancer is less likely than absence of lung cancer overall.<|eot_id|>",
