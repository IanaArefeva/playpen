The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who cannot swim and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 36%. For students who cannot swim and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 64%. For students who can swim and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 71%. For students who can swim and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 93%. For students who cannot swim, the probability of studying hard is 11%. For students who can swim, the probability of studying hard is 68%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would ability to swim positively affect exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the subpopulation of students who do not study hard, the exam score is higher for those who can swim (71%) than for those who cannot swim (36%). In the subpopulation of students who study hard, the exam score is also higher for those who can swim (93%) than for those who cannot swim (64%). This pattern of higher exam scores among those who can swim, both in the subpopulation that does not study hard and in the subpopulation that does study hard, suggests that the direct effect of ability to swim on exam score is positive.||",
