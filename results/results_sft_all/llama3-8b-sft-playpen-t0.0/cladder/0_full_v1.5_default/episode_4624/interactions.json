The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 3%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 85%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 52%. Is dark room less likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of bright room is 3% (drinking coffee) * 48% (bright room given coffee) + 97% (not drinking coffee) * 15% (bright room given no coffee) = 1.44% (drinking coffee) + 14.55% (not drinking coffee) = 15.99%.
