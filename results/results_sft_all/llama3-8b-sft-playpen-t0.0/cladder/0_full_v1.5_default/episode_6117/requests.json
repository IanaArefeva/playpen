The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved.

Since we have a condition where parents' social status is high (caused by liking spicy food and the active confounder), this directly affects the child's intelligence. The active confounder also directly affects child's intelligence. The direct positive effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence supersedes the direct positive effect of not liking spicy food on child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
