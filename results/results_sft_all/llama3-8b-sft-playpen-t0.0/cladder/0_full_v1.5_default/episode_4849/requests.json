Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 19%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of high rainfall is 44%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of high rainfall is 78%. Is high rainfall less likely than low rainfall overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When Alice wakes up on time, the probability of high rainfall is 44%, which is lower than the 78% probability of high rainfall when she wakes up late. This suggests that Alice's on-time wake-up behavior is associated with lower rainfall likelihood. Since the probability of Alice waking up late is 19%, this behavior is not the primary driver of the overall probability of high rainfall. The direct relationship between Alice's behavior and rainfall, rather than the behavior's frequency, is what matters here.<|eot_id|>",
