The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Method 1: We look at how talent correlates with effort case by case according to elite institution admission status. Method 2: We look directly at how talent correlates with effort in general. To understand how talent affects effort, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this case, looking at the direct relationship between talent and effort in general (Method 2) is more appropriate than examining how they relate to each other through the lens of elite institution admission status (Method 1). This is because we want to directly measure the effect of talent on effort, rather than relying on an intermediate variable like admission status.<|eot_id|>",
