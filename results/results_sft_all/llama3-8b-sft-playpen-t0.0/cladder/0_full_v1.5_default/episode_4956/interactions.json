The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Vaccination status has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on black hair. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on black hair. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of black hair is 51%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of black hair is 40%. For vaccinated individuals, would it be more likely to see black hair if the person had been vaccinated?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
