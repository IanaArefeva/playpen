The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on having a brother and disease. Having a brother has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of having a brother is 53%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 29%. For people who have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 62%. Is recovering from the disease more likely than dying from the disease overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of recovering from the disease is 29% for those without a brother and 62% for those with a brother. The overall probability of recovering from the disease is the weighted average of the two probabilities, which is (0.47 * 0.29) + (0.53 * 0.62) = 0.34 + 0.33 = 0.67. The probability of dying from the disease is 1 - 0.67 = 0.33.
