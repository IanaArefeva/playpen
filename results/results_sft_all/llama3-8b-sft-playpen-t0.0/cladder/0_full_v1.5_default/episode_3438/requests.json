Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of solar eclipse is 53%. The probability of no solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 35%. The probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 20%. Is the chance of arriving to school on time smaller when observing solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 20%. The direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is positive, meaning that solar eclipse is associated with a higher probability of Alice's arrival. The direct effect of no solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is also positive, meaning that no solar eclipse is associated with a higher probability of Alice's arrival. The direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not negative, and the direct effect of no solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not negative. The probability of solar eclipse and no solar eclipse is 53% and 47% respectively, and the probability of Alice's arrival is higher in both scenarios. The direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not negative, and the direct effect of no solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not negative. The probability of solar eclipse and no solar eclipse is 53% and 47% respectively, and the probability of Alice's arrival is higher in both scenarios. The direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not negative, and the direct effect of no solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not negative.
