Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. We know that male gender causes non-competitive department. male gender and competitive department causes being allergic to peanuts.

The direct relationship between department competitiveness and being allergic to peanuts further solidifies the connection between male gender and being allergic to peanuts. If we consider a different condition where the individual is not male, we must account for the potential shift in department competitiveness and its subsequent effect on being allergic to peanuts. In this case, the absence of male gender could lead to a more competitive department, which in turn could lead to being allergic to peanuts. This chain of cause and effect still places the individual at risk of being allergic to peanuts, even if they are not male.<|eot_id|>",
