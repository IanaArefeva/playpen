The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 53%. For people who do not drink coffee and non-hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 95%. For people who do not drink coffee and hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 85%. For people who drink coffee and non-hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 94%. For people who drink coffee and hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 71%. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does the chance of broken bones decrease when drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The difference in the probability of broken bones between those who drink coffee and those who do not is 23% for hospitalization and 1% for non hospitalization. The difference in the probability of broken bones between those who drink coffee and those who do not is larger for hospitalization than for non hospitalization, which means that the chance of broken bones does not decrease when drinking coffee for hospitalization.<|eot_id|>",
