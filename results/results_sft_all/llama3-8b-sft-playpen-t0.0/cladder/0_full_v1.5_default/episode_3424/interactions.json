The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 14%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 28%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 86%. Is the forest on fire less likely than the forest not on fire overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the forest on fire is 28% for those who do not like spicy food and 86% for those who like spicy food. The probability of the forest on fire is also 100% for the smoker, since the direct effect of the smoker on the forest is not subject to the condition of liking spicy food. The overall probability of the forest on fire is the sum of the products of the individual probabilities: (0.14 * 0.86) + (0.86 * 1) + (0.86 * 0.28) = 0.12 + 0.86 + 0.24 = 1.22. The forest is on fire with a probability of 1.22, which is higher than the probability of the forest not on fire (1 - 1.22 = -0.22), so the forest is on fire more likely than the forest not on fire overall.||",
