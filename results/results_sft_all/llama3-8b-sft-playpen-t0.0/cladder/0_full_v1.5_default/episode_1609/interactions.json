The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 30%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 69%. Does the captain negatively affect prisoner through the corporal and the private?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the prisoner's death is higher when the captain executes the prisoner (69%) than when the captain releases the prisoner (30%). This difference in probability suggests that the captain's actions have a negative effect on the prisoner. The additional relationships through the corporal and the private do not change the overall direction of the captain's effect on the prisoner, which remains negative.||",
