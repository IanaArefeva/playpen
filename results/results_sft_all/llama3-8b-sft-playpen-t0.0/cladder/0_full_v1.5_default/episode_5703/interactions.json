The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 42%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 69%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 20%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 44%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 62%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 39%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 95%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 72%. The overall probability of good health is 3%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would having a sister negatively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The table only provides the probability of high infant mortality for different groups of infants, which does not directly imply a negative effect of having a sister on infant's birth weight. In fact, the table shows that for infants who have a sister and normal birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 44%, which is lower than the probability of high infant mortality for infants who do not have a sister and normal birth weight (69%). This suggests that having a sister might have a positive or neutral effect on infant's birth weight, which in turn could lead to lower infant mortality.||",
