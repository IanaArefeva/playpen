  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how having a sister correlates with infant mortality case by case according to infant's birth weight. Method 2: We look directly at how having a sister correlates with infant mortality in general. To understand how having a sister affects infant mortality, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?",
