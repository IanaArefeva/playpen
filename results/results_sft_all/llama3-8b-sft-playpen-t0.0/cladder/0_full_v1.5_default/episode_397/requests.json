Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 66%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin death is 66%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin death is 59%. Is penguin death less likely than penguin lives overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of taking the stairs is 34% (100% - 66%) and the probability of taking the elevator is 66%, we can weight the probabilities of penguin death by the corresponding probabilities of taking the stairs and the elevator. The overall probability of penguin death is then (0.34 * 0.66) + (0.66 * 0.59) = 0.2234 + 0.3924 = 0.6158. The probability of penguin lives is 1 - 0.6158 = 0.3842. Since 0.6158 is greater than 0.3842, penguin death is more likely than penguin lives overall.<|eot_id|>",
