The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of having visited England is 37%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 23%. For people who have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 66%. Is employee being fired less likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since having visited England directly affects the probability of the employee being fired (66% vs. 23% for those who haven't), we need to consider the overall probability of having visited England (37%) and its impact on the probability of the employee being fired. If we condition on having visited England, the probability of the employee being fired is 66%, which is higher than the 23% probability for those who haven't. This suggests that the direct relationship between having visited England and the probability of the employee being fired could lead to a higher overall probability of the employee being fired than not being fired, especially since the probability of having visited England is already higher than 50%.||",
