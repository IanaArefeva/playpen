The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on black hair. Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of black hair is 74%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of black hair is 42%. For people who went to tanning salons, would it be less likely to see black hair if the person had not had a tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of black hair is lower for people who used tanning salon treatments (42%) than for those who did not (74%). This difference in probability is not a result of the tanning salon use itself but rather of the tanning salon treatment. If we condition on tanning salon use, the direct effect of the tanning salon treatment on black hair still exists, and this direct effect is not counteracted by the tanning salon use. In other words, the tanning salon use does not reduce the direct effect of the tanning salon treatment on black hair.||",
