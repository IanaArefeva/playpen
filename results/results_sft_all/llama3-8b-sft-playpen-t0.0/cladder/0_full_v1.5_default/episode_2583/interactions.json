The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 86%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 51%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 76%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 43%. The overall probability of smoking is 82%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is higher than among nonsmokers only when there is a high tar deposit. In the absence of a high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is the same for both smokers and nonsmokers (76%). Since the probability of a high tar deposit is lower among smokers (51%) than among nonsmokers (86%), the overall probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than among nonsmokers.||",
