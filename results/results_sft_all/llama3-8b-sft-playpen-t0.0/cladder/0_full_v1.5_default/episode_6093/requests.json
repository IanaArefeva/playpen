Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. We know that male gender causes competitive department. male gender and competitive department causes being allergic to peanuts.

Since male gender directly affects the competitive department, and the competitive department in turn affects the likelihood of being allergic to peanuts, we need to consider the chain of causality. If male gender instead of non-male gender, then the competitive department would still be present, and the chain of causality would still lead to being allergic to peanuts. The direct relationship between male gender and being allergic to peanuts is not isolated from the intermediate variable of competitive department, so we must consider the entire chain of causality.<|eot_id|>",
