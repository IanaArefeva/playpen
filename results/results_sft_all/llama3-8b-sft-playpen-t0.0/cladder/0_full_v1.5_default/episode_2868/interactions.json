The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that waking up late and heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is heavy traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if waking up late instead of waking up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that both waking up late and heavy traffic lead to late arrival, and we have observed that there is heavy traffic on the road, the direct effect of waking up late is neutralized by the direct effect of the heavy traffic. In this specific scenario, the heavy traffic is the primary cause of the late arrival, and the late wake-up time does not add any additional burden to the already existing cause of late arrival (the heavy traffic).||",
