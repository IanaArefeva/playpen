Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 82%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 73%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being a smoker is 82%, and the probability of being a nonsmoker is 18%. The probability of lung cancer among smokers is 73%, and the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers is 33%. The overall probability of lung cancer is (0.82 * 0.73) + (0.18 * 0.33) = 0.60 + 0.0594 = 0.6594. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.6594 = 0.3406. Since 0.6594 is greater than 0.3406, lung cancer is more likely than absence of lung cancer overall.<|eot_id|>",
