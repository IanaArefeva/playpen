Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 81%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 42%. For individuals who are male, would it be less likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that being male directly decreases the likelihood of admission acceptance. If we condition on being male, the probability of admission acceptance is already lower (42%) compared to the base rate of 81%. The counterfactual question is whether it would be less likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male. In this case, we are already in the male condition, so we need to consider the counterfactual of being male and then being in the male condition.
