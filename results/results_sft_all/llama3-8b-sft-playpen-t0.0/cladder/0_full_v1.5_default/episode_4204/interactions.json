The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and freckles. Hospital costs has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 59%. The probability of low hospital bill and freckles is 24%. The probability of high hospital bill and freckles is 22%. Is the chance of freckles smaller when observing high hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of high hospital bill is 59%, and the probability of high hospital bill and freckles is 22%. This means that the occurrence of high hospital bill already implies the occurrence of freckles, and the additional probability of freckles in the high hospital bill condition is accounted for by the direct relationship between hospital costs and freckles. The probability of freckles in the high hospital bill condition is not smaller than in the general population, as the direct relationship between hospital costs and freckles already fully explains the occurrence of freckles in the high hospital bill condition.||",
