The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. Method 1: We look at how medication correlates with heart condition case by case according to blood pressure. Method 2: We look directly at how medication correlates with heart condition in general. To understand how medication affects heart condition, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the relationship between medication and heart condition is not fully mediated by blood pressure. In other words, medication can directly influence heart condition, independent of its effect on blood pressure. Method 1 involves looking at the relationship between medication and heart condition through the lens of blood pressure, which could lead to an incomplete or biased understanding of the direct relationship between medication and heart condition. In contrast, Method 2 directly examines the relationship between medication and heart condition, providing a more accurate representation of the direct effect of medication on heart condition.||",
