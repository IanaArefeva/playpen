Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 73%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If we condition on the person being a smoker, the probability of lung cancer is still higher than for a person who is a nonsmoker, which means that the person's history of being a smoker is still a strong risk factor for lung cancer. The person's past history as a nonsmoker does not reduce the risk associated with their current smoking behavior, so it is not more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
