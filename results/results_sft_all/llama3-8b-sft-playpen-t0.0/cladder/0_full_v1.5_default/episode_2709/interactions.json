The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 73%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If we condition on the person being a smoker, the probability of lung cancer is still higher than for a person who is a nonsmoker, which means that the person's history of being a smoker is still a strong risk factor for lung cancer. The person's past history as a nonsmoker does not reduce the risk associated with their current smoking behavior, so it is not more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker.||",
