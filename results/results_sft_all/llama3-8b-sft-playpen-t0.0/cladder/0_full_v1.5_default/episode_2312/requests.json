Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 44%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 60%. For obese people, would it be more likely to see long lifespan if the person had been normal weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, the probability of a long lifespan is 44% for normal weight people, which is lower than the 60% probability of a long lifespan for obese people. This suggests that being normal weight does not directly lead to a higher probability of a long lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
