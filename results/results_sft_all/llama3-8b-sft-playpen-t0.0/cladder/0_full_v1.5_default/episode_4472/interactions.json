The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 18%. The probability of not listening to jazz and lung cancer is 33%. The probability of listening to jazz and lung cancer is 8%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing listening to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between pollution and lung cancer is also not strong, as the direct effect of pollution on lung cancer is not quantified. The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is strong, as the probability of lung cancer given smoking is likely to be higher than the probability of lung cancer given no smoking. Since the direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is not strong, and the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is strong, the chance of lung cancer is not larger when observing listening to jazz.||",
