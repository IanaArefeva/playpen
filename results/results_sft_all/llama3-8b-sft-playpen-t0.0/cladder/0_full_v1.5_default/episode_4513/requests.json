Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 74%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between jazz and tar deposit is that jazz directly affects the probability of a higher tar deposit. Since the person in question already listens to jazz, we are looking at the counterfactual where they do not. In this counterfactual, the person's probability of a higher tar deposit remains the same, as the direct relationship between jazz and tar deposit is still present. Since the person's probability of a higher tar deposit remains the same, their probability of lung cancer also remains the same, as the direct relationship between a higher tar deposit and lung cancer is still present.<|eot_id|>",
