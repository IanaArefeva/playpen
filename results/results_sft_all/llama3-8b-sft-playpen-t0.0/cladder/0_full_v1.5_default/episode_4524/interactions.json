The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and brown eyes. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on brown eyes. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 43%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and brown eyes is 49%. The probability of smoking mother and brown eyes is 17%. Is the chance of brown eyes larger when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The Venn diagram will have two main areas: one for the condition of the mother's smoking status and the other for the condition of brown eyes. The area where the two conditions overlap will contain the joint probability of both the mother being a smoker and the child having brown eyes. The area outside this overlap will contain the joint probability of the child having brown eyes and the mother not being a smoker. The area outside this area will contain the joint probability of the child not having brown eyes and the mother being a smoker. The area outside this area will contain the joint probability of the child not having brown eyes and the mother not being a smoker. The Venn diagram will show that the area outside the overlap is larger than the area inside the overlap, which means that the probability of brown eyes is larger when the mother is not a smoker than when she is a smoker.||",
