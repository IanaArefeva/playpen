Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 96%. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 57%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 52%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 10%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 30%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 36%. For managers who sign termination letters, would it be less likely to see employee being fired if the manager had signed the termination letter?",
