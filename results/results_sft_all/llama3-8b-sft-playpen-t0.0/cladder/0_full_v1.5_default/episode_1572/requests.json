The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 96%. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 57%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 52%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 10%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 30%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 36%. For managers who sign termination letters, would it be less likely to see employee being fired if the manager had signed the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this case, the probability of the director signing the termination letter is also 36%. The probability of the employee being fired when the manager and director both sign the termination letter is 10%. In the absence of the manager's signature, the probability of the director signing the termination letter is 30%. The probability of the employee being fired when the manager doesn't sign the termination letter but the director does is 57%. Since 10% is less than 57%, it is less likely to see the employee being fired if the manager had signed the termination letter.\nHowever, we need to consider the joint probability of the manager and director both signing the termination letter. The probability of the manager signing the termination letter is 36%, and the probability of the director signing the termination letter given that the manager has already done so is also 36%. This joint probability is 36% * 36% = 12.96%. In the absence of the manager's signature, the probability of the director signing the termination letter is 30%. The probability of the manager not signing the termination letter is 64% (100% - 36%). The probability of the director signing the termination letter given that the manager doesn't sign is 30%. The joint probability of the manager not signing and the director signing is 64% * 30% = 19.2%. The probability of the manager and director both not",
