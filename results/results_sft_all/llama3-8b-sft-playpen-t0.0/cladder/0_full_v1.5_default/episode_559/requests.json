The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 61%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 80%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be more likely to see high salary if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The additional information that the person would not have had a college degree does not change the fact that they still have a college degree or higher, which already confers a higher probability of high salary. In other words, the person's educational background is still \"college degree or higher\" in this scenario, so the probability of high salary remains the same.<|eot_id|>",
