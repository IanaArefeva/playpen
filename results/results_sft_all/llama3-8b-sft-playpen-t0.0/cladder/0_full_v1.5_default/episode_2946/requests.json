Since male gender or competitive department causes admission acceptance, and we already established that male gender is associated with a lower degree of competition, this suggests that male gender is not a direct cause of admission acceptance in this context. The direct effect of male gender on non-competitive department and the subsequent effect of competitive department on admission acceptance imply that male gender is not a direct cause of admission acceptance. Therefore, the applicant would not get rejected if male gender instead of non-male gender.<|eot_id|>",
