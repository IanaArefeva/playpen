The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 91%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 83%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 56%. Is curly hair less likely than straight hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of citrus consumption is 91%, we can conclude that the overall probability of curly hair is higher than the probability of straight hair. This is because the direct effect of citrus on curly hair is positive, and the large majority of the population is consuming citrus. The specific numbers for the probability of curly hair in citrus consumers (56%) and non-consumers (83%) do not directly impact the overall likelihood of curly hair compared to straight hair, as the citrus consumption rate far outweighs the non-consumption rate.||",
