Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. We know that having visited England and high skill level causes white-collar job. having visited England or high skill level or white-collar job causes high salary.

Since the person already has a high skill level, which also directly affects occupation and salary, we need to consider the interaction between having visited England and the person's skill level. If the person has a high skill level, then having visited England would still lead to a white-collar job, and the white-collar job would still lead to a high salary. In this case, having visited England would not directly affect the person's salary, as the high skill level already ensures a white-collar job and a high salary.<|eot_id|>",
