The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 73%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 46%. For children with intelligent parents, would it be less likely to see being lactose intolerant if the child had unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the parents' intelligence has a protective effect against lactose intolerance in children. If we condition on the parents' intelligence being high, the probability of the child being lactose intolerant is lower than if we condition on the parents' intelligence being low. This indicates that the parents' intelligence is a confounding variable that needs to be controlled for when studying the relationship between parents' social status and children's lactose intolerance.||",
