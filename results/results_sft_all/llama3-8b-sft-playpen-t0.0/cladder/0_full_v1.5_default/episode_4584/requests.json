The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 80%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 26%. Will having a brother increase the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The given information only shows that having a brother has a direct effect on the wife and the alarm clock, and that the wife has a direct effect on the alarm clock. The probability of the alarm clock ringing is higher for people who do not have a brother (80%) than for those who have a brother (26%). This suggests that the relationship between having a brother and the probability of the alarm clock ringing is likely to be negative, rather than positive.<|eot_id|>",
