Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 9%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 58%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 32%. Is scurvy less likely than no scurvy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of citrus consumption is 9%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction to find the overall probability of scurvy: (0.09) * 32% + (0.91) * 58% = 5.28% + 52.98% = 58.26%. This is higher than the probability of no scurvy, which is 100% - 58.26% = 41.74%.<|eot_id|>",
