Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 46%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 60%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 39%.

Since the probability of not receiving treatment is 54% (100% - 46%), we can calculate the overall probability of recovery as follows: (0.46 * 0.39) + (0.54 * 0.60) = 0.1854 + 0.324 = 0.5094. The probability of non-recovery is 1 - 0.5094 = 0.4906. Since 0.5094 is less than 0.4906, we conclude that non-recovery is more likely than recovery overall.<|eot_id|>",
