The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 46%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 60%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 39%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of not receiving treatment is 54% (100% - 46%), we can calculate the overall probability of recovery as follows: (0.46 * 0.39) + (0.54 * 0.60) = 0.1854 + 0.324 = 0.5094. The probability of non-recovery is 1 - 0.5094 = 0.4906. Since 0.5094 is less than 0.4906, we conclude that non-recovery is more likely than recovery overall.||",
