The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. Method 1: We look directly at how having a brother correlates with salary in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to skill. To understand how having a brother affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the direct relationship between having a brother and skill, and the direct relationship between skill and salary, imply that the effect of having a brother on salary is fully mediated by skill. In other words, the relationship between having a brother and salary is only through the intervening variable of skill. If we look at the general correlation between having a brother and salary (Method 1), we would be confounding the direct relationship between having a brother and skill with the direct relationship between skill and salary, leading to an incorrect conclusion. In contrast, looking at the relationship case by case according to skill (Method 2) allows us to control for the intervening variable and directly observe the relationship between having a brother and salary through the correct intervening variable of skill.||",
