The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. We know that the camper lighting a match or the chain-smoker lighting a match causes the forest on fire. We observed the chain-smoker lights a match. Would the forest doesn't burn down if the camper lighting a match instead of the camper not lighting a match?",
