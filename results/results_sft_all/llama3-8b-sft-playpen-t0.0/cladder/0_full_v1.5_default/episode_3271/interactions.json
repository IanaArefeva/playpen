The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 21%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 51%. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 35%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 66%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 28%. Will having visited England increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The correct path is: \"CEO\" has a direct effect on \"director\" and \"having visited England\", and \"director\" has a direct effect on \"employee being fired\". The probability of \"employee being fired\" is higher when \"CEO\" has made a decision to fire the \"employee\" and \"CEO\" has \"visited England\", which in turn means that \"director\" is more likely to fire the \"employee\" since \"director\" is more likely to have made a similar decision to \"CEO\" (firing the \"employee\") given that \"CEO\" has \"visited England\".||",
