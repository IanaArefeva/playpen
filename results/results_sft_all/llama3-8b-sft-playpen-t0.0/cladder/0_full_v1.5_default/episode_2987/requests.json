The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. We know that obesity and smoker causes having diabetes. obesity or smoker or having diabetes causes long lifespan. We observed the person is a smoker. Would the person has a long lifespan if obesity instead of normal weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the person is a smoker, we can conclude that they have diabetes. Additionally, we know that having diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan, and that a person with diabetes will have a long lifespan. The condition of being a smoker supersedes the condition of having a normal weight, and the direct effect of being a smoker on diabetes and lifespan supersedes the potential effect of having a normal weight on these outcomes.<|eot_id|>",
