Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 43%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 10%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 10%. Is talent less likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since 57% of the population is unattractive and 43% is attractive, the overall probability of having talent is a weighted average of the two groups, which is (0.57 * 0.10) + (0.43 * 0.10) = 0.095. The probability of lacking talent is 1 - 0.095 = 0.905. Since 0.095 is less than 0.905, it is more likely than lacking talent overall.<|eot_id|>",
