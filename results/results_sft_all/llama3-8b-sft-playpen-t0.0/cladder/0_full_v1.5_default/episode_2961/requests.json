The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender or in-state residency or competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the resident is in-state. Would the applicant gets admitted if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that the applicant is in-state (and in-state residency is a direct cause of competitive department), we can conclude that the in-state residency is the primary cause of the competitive department. The male gender is not necessary for the competitive department in this case, as the in-state residency already guarantees it. Therefore, if we change the male gender to a non-male gender, the competitive department will still be present, and the direct effect of the competitive department on admission acceptance will still lead to admission.<|eot_id|>",
