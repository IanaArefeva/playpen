The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of having visited England is 43%. The probability of not having visited England and employee being fired is 16%. The probability of having visited England and employee being fired is 28%. Is the chance of employee being fired smaller when observing having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that having visited England is associated with a higher risk of being fired, rather than a lower risk.<|eot_id|>",
