The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a brother and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Having a brother has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 34%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 42%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of having a brother is 34%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of having a brother is 63%. Will having a brother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of having a brother on normal infant birth weight is not isolated from the effects of the unobserved confounders and the cigarette tax. In areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of having a brother is higher (63%) than in areas with low cigarette tax (34%), which suggests that the cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Since the cigarette tax also has a direct effect on normal infant birth weight (with a higher probability of normal birth weight in areas with high cigarette tax), this intervening variable must be accounted for when assessing the relationship between having a brother and normal infant birth weight.<|eot_id|>",
