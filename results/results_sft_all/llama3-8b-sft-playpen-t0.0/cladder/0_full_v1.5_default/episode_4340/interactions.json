The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 6%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and freckles is 12%. The probability of smoking mother and freckles is 3%. Is the chance of freckles larger when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The birth weight of the infant, which is directly related to both maternal smoking and health condition, also affects the likelihood of freckles. Since the health condition is unobserved, we must consider the joint probability of the observed variables. The probability of a smoking mother and freckles is 3%, and the probability of a nonsmoking mother and freckles is 12%. The direct relationship between maternal smoking and freckles is not strong enough to counteract the higher joint probability of a nonsmoking mother and freckles, which suggests that the chance of freckles is larger when observing a nonsmoking mother.||",
