The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 31%. The probability of not liking spicy food and dark room is 21%. The probability of liking spicy food and dark room is 19%. Is the chance of dark room smaller when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between the candle and the room is the key here. The candle's effect on the room is not dependent on whether you like spicy food or not. The probability of dark room is determined by the direct relationship between the candle and the room, not by the person's food preferences.<|eot_id|>",
