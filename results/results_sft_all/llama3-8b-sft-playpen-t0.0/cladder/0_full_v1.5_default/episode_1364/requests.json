Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 7%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 63%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 6%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer given smoking is 6%, which is lower than the probability of lung cancer given nonsmoking (63%). This suggests that the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is not strong enough to offset the higher base rate of lung cancer among nonsmokers.<|eot_id|>",
