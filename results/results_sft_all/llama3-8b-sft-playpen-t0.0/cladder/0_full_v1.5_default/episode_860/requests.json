The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 54%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 26%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 79%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 51%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 37%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 46%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 76%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 85%. The overall probability of confounder active is 48%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would parents' intelligence negatively affect child's intelligence?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The negative relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence through parents' social status is also positive, as children with intelligent parents and high social status have a higher probability of being intelligent than children with unintelligent parents and high social status. The overall positive direct relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence supersedes the positive negative relationship through parents' social status, leading to a positive overall relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
