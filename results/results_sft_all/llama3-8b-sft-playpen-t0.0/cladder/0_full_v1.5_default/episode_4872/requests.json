Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 11%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 40%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 9%. Is the chance of high rainfall larger when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between Alice's wakefulness and rainfall does not imply that the probability of high rainfall is higher when she wakes up late. The joint probability of high rainfall and late wakefulness is 9%, and the joint probability of high rainfall and on-time wakefulness is also 9%. The independence of the two direct relationships (Alice's wakefulness and rainfall, and traffic and rainfall) means that the probability of high rainfall is not affected by Alice's wakefulness.<|eot_id|>",
