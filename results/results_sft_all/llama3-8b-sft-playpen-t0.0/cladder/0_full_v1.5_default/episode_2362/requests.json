The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 13%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 61%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 45%. Is scurvy more likely than no scurvy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of citrus consumption is 13%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction to get the overall probability of scurvy: (0.13 * 0.45) + (0.87 * 0.61) = 0.0585 + 0.5283 = 0.5868. The probability of no scurvy is 1 - 0.5868 = 0.4132. Since 0.5868 is greater than 0.4132, scurvy is more likely than no scurvy in this world.<|eot_id|>",
