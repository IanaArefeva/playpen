The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 61%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 81%. For people who have a brother, would it be more likely to see high salary if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the positive effect of having a brother on salary is entirely mediated by the increase in skill. If we condition on not having a brother, we are removing the direct cause of higher skill, and the relationship between skill and salary remains. Since the probability of high salary is 61% for those without a brother, and 81% for those with a brother, the difference in probability is entirely due to the difference in skill levels, not any direct effect of having a brother on salary.||",
