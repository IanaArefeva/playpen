The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 77%. The probability of not drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 7%. The probability of drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 35%. Is the chance of ringing alarm smaller when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The overall probability of the alarm ringing is higher when coffee is consumed (35% vs. 7% when coffee is not consumed), which suggests that the positive direct effect of coffee on the alarm clock outweighs the positive direct effect of the wife on the alarm clock.||",
