Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 77%. The probability of not drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 7%. The probability of drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 35%. Is the chance of ringing alarm smaller when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of the alarm ringing is higher when coffee is consumed (35% vs. 7% when coffee is not consumed), which suggests that the positive direct effect of coffee on the alarm clock outweighs the positive direct effect of the wife on the alarm clock.<|eot_id|>",
