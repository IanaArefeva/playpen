Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 89%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 29%. Will smoking decrease the chance of college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, the direct effect of smoking on college admission is not the only relevant relationship here. The direct effect of effort on college admission is also positive, and this relationship is not directly influenced by whether someone smokes or not. In this world, the positive direct effect of effort on college admission likely counteracts the negative direct effect of smoking on college admission, leading to a net positive relationship between smoking and college admission.<|eot_id|>",
