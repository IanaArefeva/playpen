The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Vaccination status has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of vaccination is 73%. The probability of lack of vaccination and smallpox survival is 18%. The probability of vaccination and smallpox survival is 53%. Is the chance of smallpox survival smaller when observing vaccination?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of smallpox survival is also directly affected by the occurrence of smallpox, which in turn is directly related to the absence of vaccination. In this world, the probability of smallpox is higher when there is no vaccination, which directly affects the probability of smallpox survival. The direct relationship between vaccination and smallpox survival is counterbalanced by the higher probability of smallpox occurrence when there is no vaccination, which ultimately affects the probability of smallpox survival.||",
