Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 14%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 34%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, and this difference is not accounted for by any other direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer, we can conclude that the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is positive. This means that, in this specific world, smoking will increase the chance of lung cancer, not decrease it.<|eot_id|>",
