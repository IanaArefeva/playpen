The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of being able to swim is 6%. For students who cannot swim, the probability of high exam score is 34%. For students who can swim, the probability of high exam score is 68%. Is high exam score less likely than low exam score overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the ability to swim directly contributes to higher exam scores. The studying habits of students who can and cannot swim are not directly related to their exam scores in this world. The exam score is primarily determined by the ability to swim. Since the probability of being able to swim is 6%, and this directly affects exam score, we need to consider the joint probability of being able to swim and having a high exam score. The joint probability of being able to swim and having a high exam score is 0.4 (6% chance of being able to swim times 68% chance of high exam score given that one can swim), and the joint probability of not being able to swim and having a high exam score is 0.26 (94% chance of not being able to swim times 34% chance of high exam score given that one cannot swim). The joint probability of being able to swim and having a low exam score is 0.32 (6% chance of being able to swim times 32% chance of a low exam score given that one can swim), and the joint probability of not being able to swim and having a low exam score is 0.66 (94% chance of not being able to swim times 66% chance of a low exam score given that",
