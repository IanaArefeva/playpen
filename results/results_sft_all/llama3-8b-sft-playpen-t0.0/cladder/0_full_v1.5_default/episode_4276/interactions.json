The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 39%. The probability of vaccine refusal and being lactose intolerant is 45%. The probability of getting the vaccine and being lactose intolerant is 9%. Is the chance of being lactose intolerant larger when observing getting the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of being lactose intolerant in the general population is 45% (P(LI)). The probability of being vaccinated is 39% (P(V)). To find the probability of being lactose intolerant and vaccinated, we need to consider the joint probability of both events, which is 9% (P(LI and V)). The target quantity we want to find is the probability of being lactose intolerant given that the person has been vaccinated, which is 9% (P(LI|V)). This is less than the general probability of being lactose intolerant (45%), so the chance of being lactose intolerant is not larger when observing getting the vaccine.||",
