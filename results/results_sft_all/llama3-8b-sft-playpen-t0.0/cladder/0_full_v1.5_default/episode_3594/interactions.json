The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 48%. For people who do not have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 20%. For people who have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 77%. For people who have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 46%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 37%. For people who have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 60%. If we disregard the mediation effect through blood pressure, would having a sister positively affect heart condition?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a healthy heart is higher for people who have a sister and with low blood pressure (77%) than for those who do not have a sister and with the same condition (48%). This might imply a positive effect of having a sister on heart condition in the context of low blood pressure. In the case of high blood pressure, the probability of a healthy heart is lower for people who have a sister (46%) than for those who do not have a sister (20%). This could indicate a negative effect of having a sister on heart condition in the context of high blood pressure. Since the direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition is not consistently positive across both blood pressure scenarios, we conclude that having a sister does not have a positive effect on heart condition when we disregard the mediation through blood pressure.||",
