The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 11%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 22%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 87%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 97%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 47%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\n\nLet's first examine the counterfactuals for the large kidney stone group. If a patient with a large kidney stone does not receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 87%. If the same patient with a large kidney stone does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 97%. This shows that treatment has a positive effect on recovery for large kidney stone patients, increasing the probability of recovery by 10%.\n\nNext, we need to consider the counterfactuals for the small kidney stone group. If a patient with a small kidney stone does not receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 11%. If the same patient with a small kidney stone does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 22%. This shows that treatment also has a positive effect on recovery for small kidney stone patients, increasing the probability of recovery by 11%.\n\nHowever, the key insight here is that the overall probability of large kidney stone is 47%. This means that in the general population, more than half of the patients will have large kidney stones. Since we already established that treatment has a positive effect on recovery for large kidney stone patients, this suggests that the overall effect of treatment on recovery will be driven by the large kidney stone group.\n\nGiven that",
