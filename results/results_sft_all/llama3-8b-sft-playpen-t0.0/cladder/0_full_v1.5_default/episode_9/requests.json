Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 51%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 49%. For husbands that set the alarm, would it be more likely to see ringing alarm if the husband had not set the alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm ringing is 49% when the husband sets the alarm and 51% when the husband doesn't set the alarm. The additional condition of the husband not setting the alarm does not change the probability of the alarm ringing, as the direct relationship between the husband and the alarm is already established.<|eot_id|>",
