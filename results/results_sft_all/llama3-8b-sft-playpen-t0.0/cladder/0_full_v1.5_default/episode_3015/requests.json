Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that male gender causes receives treatment. male gender or receives treatment causes recovery. We observed the patient is not male.

Since the patient is not male, we can conclude that the patient does not receive treatment. In this case, we need to consider the relationship between not male and not treats. The direct effect of not male on not treats is not established, and we also need to consider the relationship between not male and treats. The direct effect of not male on treats is also not established. In the absence of direct effects, we need to consider the relationships through the intermediate variable, which is the direct effect of male on treats. Since the direct effect of male on treats is established, we can conclude that the direct effect of not male on treats is also established, and the direct effect of not male on not treats is also established. Finally, we need to consider the relationship between not treats and not male.
