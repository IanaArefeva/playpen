Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 35%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 80%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 35%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 70%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 7%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 46%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 33%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 69%. The overall probability of high pollution is 47%. Does gene negatively affect lung cancer through smoking?",
