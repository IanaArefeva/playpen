The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 60%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 65%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 29%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 22%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 72%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 41%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 35%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 12%. The overall probability of confounder active is 52%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would parents' intelligence positively affect child's intelligence?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The unobserved \"conflater\" also exerts a direct effect on both child's intelligence and parents' social status. The probability of child's intelligence being high is higher when the confounder is active than when it is not, which suggests that the confounder has a positive effect on child's intelligence. Since the direct relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence is not the only factor at play, we must consider the joint effect of both parents' intelligence and the confounder on child's intelligence. The joint effect of parents' intelligence and the confounder on child's intelligence is not positive, as the probability of child's intelligence being high is lower when parents' intelligence is high and the confounder is active than when parents' intelligence is high and the confounder is not active.||",
