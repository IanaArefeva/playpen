The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who cannot swim and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 32%. For students who cannot swim and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 56%. For students who can swim and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 53%. For students who can swim and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 86%. For students who cannot swim, the probability of studying hard is 10%. For students who can swim, the probability of studying hard is 85%. Does ability to swim negatively affect exam score through studying habit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key insight here is that the direct effect of ability to swim on exam score is positive (86% for those who can swim and study hard), and the direct effect of studying habits on exam score is also positive (56% for those who study hard but can't swim, and 86% for those who study hard and can swim). The negative relationship between ability to swim and exam score through studying habits is not present in the given conditions.||",
