The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 85%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 62%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 87%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 56%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 86%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 45%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 85%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 46%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 95%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect admission status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The table only provides the probability of admission acceptance for different subgroups, but it does not directly link the probability of being male (or female) to the probability of being admitted. The table does show that the probability of being admitted is higher for males than for females in the competitive department (56% vs. 62%), but this does not imply a direct positive effect of being male on the probability of being admitted. In fact, the table does not provide any direct evidence of a positive relationship between being male and being admitted, and the differences in admission probabilities between males and females are not consistently positive across all subgroups.<|eot_id|>",
