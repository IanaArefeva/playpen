The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 86%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 74%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 28%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 13%. The overall probability of male gender is 50%. Will receives treatment decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of recovery for male patients not receiving treatment is lower than for male patients receiving treatment, which suggests that treatment has a positive effect on male patients. The probability of recovery for female patients not receiving treatment is 86%, and for female patients receiving treatment is 74%. The probability of recovery for female patients not receiving treatment is higher than for female patients receiving treatment, which suggests that treatment has a negative effect on female patients. Since the overall probability of male gender is 50%, the positive effect of treatment on male patients and the negative effect of treatment on female patients balance each other out, so that the overall probability of recovery is not affected by whether or not the patient is male.<|eot_id|>",
