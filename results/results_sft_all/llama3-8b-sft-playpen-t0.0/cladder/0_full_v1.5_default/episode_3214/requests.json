The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 26%. The probability of not liking spicy food and dark room is 41%. The probability of liking spicy food and dark room is 22%.

The probability of not liking spicy food and dark room is 41%, which is higher than the probability of liking spicy food and dark room (22%). This suggests that the chance of dark room is larger when not observing liking spicy food.<|eot_id|>",
