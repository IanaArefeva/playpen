The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 50%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 61%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 67%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 32%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In areas with high cigarette tax, both the probability of normal infant birth weight and the probability of a smoking mother are higher than in areas with low cigarette tax. This suggests that the positive association between maternal smoking and normal infant birth weight in areas with high cigarette tax is likely due to the positive effect of the cigarette tax on both maternal smoking and normal infant birth weight, rather than a direct effect of maternal smoking on normal infant birth weight.<|eot_id|>",
