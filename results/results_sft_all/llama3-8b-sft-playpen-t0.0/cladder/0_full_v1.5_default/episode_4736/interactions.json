The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of having visited England is 43%. The probability of not having visited England and the prisoner's death is 12%. The probability of having visited England and the prisoner's death is 31%. Is the chance of the prisoner's death smaller when observing having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The corporal and the private both have direct effects on the prisoner, and the probability of the prisoner's death is higher when England is visited (31% vs. 12%). This suggests that the positive relationship between having visited England and the probability of the prisoner's death is not offset by the direct effects of the corporal and the private on the prisoner.||",
