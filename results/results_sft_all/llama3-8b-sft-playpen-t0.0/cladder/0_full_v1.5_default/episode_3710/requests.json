The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 45%. The probability of high school degree or lower and black hair is 17%. The probability of college degree or higher and black hair is 18%. Is the chance of black hair larger when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that black hair is more likely to occur in the absence of a college degree or higher.<|eot_id|>",
