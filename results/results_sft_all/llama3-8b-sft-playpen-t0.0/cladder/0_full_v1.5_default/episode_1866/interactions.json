The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 80%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 22%. Will taking medication decrease the chance of healthy heart?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of medication on blood pressure is not directly relevant to the question of whether medication decreases the chance of a healthy heart. The direct effect of blood pressure on heart condition is also not directly relevant to this question. The key point is that medication directly affects heart condition, and this direct effect is a reduction in the probability of a healthy heart.||",
