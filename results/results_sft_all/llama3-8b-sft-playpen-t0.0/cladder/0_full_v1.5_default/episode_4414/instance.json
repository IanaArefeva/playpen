Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 9%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 87%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 41%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 66%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 27%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 53%. The overall probability of smoking is 44%.
