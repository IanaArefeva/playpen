Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 58%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 32%. Will citrus intake increase the chance of scurvy?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that citrus consumption acts as a protective factor against scurvy, rather than increasing the chance of it.<|eot_id|>",
