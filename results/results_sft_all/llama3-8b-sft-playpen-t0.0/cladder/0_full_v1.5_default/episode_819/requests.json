Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of respiratory issues is 4%. For people with no respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 16%. For people with respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 16%. Is broken bones more likely than no broken bones overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of respiratory issues is 4%, the overall probability of broken bones is still 16% (4% of 16% + 96% of 16% = 16%). The probability of no broken bones is 84% (4% of 0% + 96% of 84% = 84%). Since 16% is less than 84%, broken bones are less likely than no broken bones overall.<|eot_id|>",
