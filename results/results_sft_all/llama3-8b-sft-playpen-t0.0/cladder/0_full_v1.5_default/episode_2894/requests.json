The direct effect of medication on heart condition is that it causes a healthy heart, and this effect is separate from the direct effect of medication on blood pressure. If the person is not taking medication, then they will not have the direct positive effect of medication on their heart condition, and their heart condition will be determined by the direct effect of their blood pressure on their heart condition. Since we know that taking medication or high blood pressure causes a healthy heart, and we also know that not taking medication will lead to high blood pressure, we can conclude that the person will not have a healthy heart if not taking medication instead of taking medication.<|eot_id|>",
