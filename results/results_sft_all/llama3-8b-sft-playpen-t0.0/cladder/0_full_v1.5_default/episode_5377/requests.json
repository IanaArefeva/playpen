The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 86%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 48%. For children with intelligent parents, would it be more likely to see being lactose intolerant if the child had unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that having intelligent parents already places a child in a lower risk category for being lactose intolerant, and further increasing the parents' intelligence would not make the child more likely to be lactose intolerant. In fact, the opposite is true: if the child already has intelligent parents, they are already in a lower risk category, and further increasing the parents' intelligence would not make the child more likely to be lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
