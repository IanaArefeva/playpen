Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. We know that encouragement causes lack of studying. encouragement and studying hard causes high exam score.

Since encouragement leads to a lack of studying, which in turn affects exam score, we must consider the net effect of encouragement on exam score. In this case, the positive effect of encouragement on exam score through studying hard is offset by the negative effect of encouragement on exam score through the lack of studying. This cancelation of effects means that the exam score remains the same, and the student would not have a high exam score if encouragement instead of discouragement.<|eot_id|>",
