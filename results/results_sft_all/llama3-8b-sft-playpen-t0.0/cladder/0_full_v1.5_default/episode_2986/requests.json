Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. We know that obesity and smoker causes having diabetes. obesity or smoker or having diabetes causes long lifespan. We observed the person is a smoker.

Since the person is a smoker, we can conclude that they have diabetes. Additionally, we know that having diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan, and that the person has a long lifespan. If the person were normal weight instead of obese, we still would not be able to conclude that they have a long lifespan, as the direct relationship between being a smoker and having a long lifespan is not established.<|eot_id|>",
