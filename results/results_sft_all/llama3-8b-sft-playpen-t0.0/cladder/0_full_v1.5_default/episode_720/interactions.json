The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 45%. The probability of non-male gender and admission acceptance is 45%. The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 34%. Is the chance of admission acceptance larger when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 34%, which is lower than the probability of male gender (45%). This suggests that male gender is not a direct cause of admission acceptance, but rather a cause of higher department competitiveness, which then leads to higher admission acceptance.||",
