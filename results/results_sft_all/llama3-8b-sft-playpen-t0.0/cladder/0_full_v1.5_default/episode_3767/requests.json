The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Method 1: We look directly at how listening to jazz correlates with effort in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to elite institution admission status. To understand how listening to jazz affects effort, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the absence of any unmentioned factors or causal relationships, we should consider the direct effects of each variable on the outcome of interest (elite institution admission status) rather than focusing on the intermediate relationship between the two variables (jazz and effort). This is because the direct relationship between jazz and the outcome is what we care about for purposes of causal inference.<|eot_id|>",
