Talent has a direct effect on fame. For people who are famous, the correlation between attractive appearance and talent is -0.27. If we look at people who are famous, does it mean that attractive appearance does not affect talent?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between two variables can be negative in one subpopulation (famous people) while still being positive in another subpopulation (all people) or in the overall population. The negative correlation in famous people might be due to confounding variables or selection bias rather than a direct causal relationship between appearance and talent.<|eot_id|>",
