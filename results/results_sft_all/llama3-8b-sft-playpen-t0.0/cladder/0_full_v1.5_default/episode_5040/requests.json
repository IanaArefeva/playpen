This is because we are looking to establish a direct relationship between the ability to speak English and the trait of having talent, rather than examining how this relationship is mediated by the trait of being famous. In other words, we want to see if there is a direct link between the ability to speak English and having talent, without being influenced by the intervening variable of fame. Method 1 directly assesses this relationship by looking at the general correlation between the ability to speak English and having talent, which is the focus of this question.<|eot_id|>",
