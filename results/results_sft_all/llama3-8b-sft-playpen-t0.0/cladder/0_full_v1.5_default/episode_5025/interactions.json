The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of speaking english is 95%. For people who do not speak english, the probability of talent is 83%. For people who speak english, the probability of talent is 83%. Is talent more likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of not speaking English is 5% and the probability of speaking English is 95%, we can conclude that the overall probability of having talent is the same as the probability of not having talent. This is because the higher probability of having talent among English speakers is offset by the lower probability of being an English speaker.||",
