The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 62%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 72%. Will having visited England increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since skill is unobserved, we must consider the joint effect of both having visited England and skill on occupation and salary. The increase in the probability of high salary among those who have visited England could be entirely due to the positive effect of skill rather than the direct effect of having visited England. In this case, the increase in the probability of high salary among those who have visited England would not be a direct result of having visited England, but rather an indirect result of the positive effect of skill.<|eot_id|>",
