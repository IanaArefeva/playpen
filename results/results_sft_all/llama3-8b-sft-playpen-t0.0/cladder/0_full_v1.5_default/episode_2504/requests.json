The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 88%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 72%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 16%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 4%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 41%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

For patients with small kidney stones, the treatment actually improves the probability of recovery (72% vs. 88%). In contrast, for patients with large kidney stones, the treatment has a negative effect on the probability of recovery (4% vs. 16%). Since the overall probability of large kidney stone is 41%, the positive treatment effect for small kidney stone patients will likely dominate the negative treatment effect for large kidney stone patients. This means that, on average, patients who have received treatment will still have a higher probability of recovery than those who have not, even if they have large kidney stones.<|eot_id|>",
