The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes sufficient vitamin C, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes no scurvy. Would the patient recovers from scurvy if citrus intake instead of absence of citrus?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The chain of causality is citrus - vitamin C - no scurvy, which means that citrus is necessary for preventing scurvy through its effect on vitamin C, but it is not a direct cause of scurvy's absence. If citrus is absent, the chain of causality is broken, and the patient will likely contract scurvy. Replacing the absence of citrus with citrus intake still means that the chain of causality is citrus - vitamin C - no scurvy, and the patient will still likely contract scurvy if citrus is not present.||",
