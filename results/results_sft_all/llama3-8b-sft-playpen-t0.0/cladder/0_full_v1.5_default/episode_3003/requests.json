Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes sufficient vitamin C, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes no scurvy.

The chain of causality is citrus -> vitamin C -> no scurvy, which means that citrus is necessary for preventing scurvy through its effect on vitamin C, but it is not a direct cause of scurvy's absence. If citrus is absent, the chain of causality is broken, and the patient will likely contract scurvy. Replacing the absence of citrus with citrus intake still means that the chain of causality is citrus -> vitamin C -> no scurvy, and the patient will still likely contract scurvy if citrus is not present.<|eot_id|>",
