The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 82%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 45%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 61%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that 0.82 * 0.61 = 0.5 of the population has a brother and a high salary. The remaining 0.18 of the population does not have a brother, and for this group, the probability of high salary is 0.45. This means that 0.18 * 0.45 = 0.08 of the population does not have a brother and has a high salary. The probability of having a brother and a high salary is 0.5, and the probability of not having a brother and a high salary is 0.08. The probability of having a brother and a low salary is 0.5 - 0.5 = 0, and the probability of not having a brother and a low salary is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.1. Since 0.5 > 0.08 > 0.1, we conclude that high salary is more likely than both having a brother and not having a brother, and that the overall probability of high salary is higher than the overall probability of having a brother and lower than the overall probability of not having a brother.<|eot_id|>",
