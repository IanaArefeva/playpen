The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes not having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to fire the employee. Would the employee is not fired if having visited England instead of not having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In both scenarios, the employee is fired. The difference lies in the chain of causality: in the first case, the CEO's decision directly affects the director and the director's action leads to the employee's firing; in the second case, having visited England directly affects the employee's fate. The key point is that the final outcome (employee being fired) remains the same in both scenarios, which means that having visited England instead of not having visited England would not change the fate of the employee.||",
