The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 53%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of dark room is 43%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of dark room is 74%. Is dark room less likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of dark room is higher for people who like spicy food (74%) than for those who do not like spicy food (43%). Since the probability of liking spicy food is 53%, we can conclude that the overall probability of dark room is higher than that of bright room.<|eot_id|>",
