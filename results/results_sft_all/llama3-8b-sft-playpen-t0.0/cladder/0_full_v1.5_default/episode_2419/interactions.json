The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 97%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 67%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 41%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 9%. The overall probability of male gender is 58%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
