The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 97%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 67%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 41%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 9%. The overall probability of male gender is 58%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of not male and not receiving treatment is 42% (since the probability of not male is 42% and the probability of not male and not treatment is the same as the probability of not male), and the probability of not male and receiving treatment is 0% (since the probability of not male and not treatment is 42% and the probability of not male and treatment is 0%). The probability of male and not treatment is 26.4% (since the probability of male is 58% and the probability of male and not treatment is the same as the probability of male), and the probability of male and treatment is 31.6% (since the probability of male is 58% and the probability of male and treatment is the same as the probability of male).
