Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between listening to jazz and being hard-working is -0.00. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does it mean that listening to jazz affects being hard-working?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The absence of a correlation between jazz and being hard-working among students accepted to elite institutions does not imply a direct effect of jazz on being hard-working. The two relationships are distinct and separate, and the absence of a correlation does not imply a direct causal link between them.<|eot_id|>",
