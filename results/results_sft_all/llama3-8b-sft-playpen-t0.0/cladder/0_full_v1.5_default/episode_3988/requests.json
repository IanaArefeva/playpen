The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 31%. For children who like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 68%. For children who like spicy food, would it be more likely to see intelligent child if the child did not like spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The parents' social status still exerts its direct effect on child's intelligence, which is not dependent on the child's likeability of spicy food. The probability of an intelligent child remains higher for children who like spicy food, as the direct positive effect of liking spicy food on child's intelligence supersedes the parents' social status.<|eot_id|>",
