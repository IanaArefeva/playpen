The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 63%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 95%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 37%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 67%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 94%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 48%. Does gender negatively affect lactose intolerance through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of being male on the probability of being lactose intolerant is still present, as seen in the differences in probability between male and non-male groups across both competitive and non-competitive departments. This direct effect of male gender on lactose intolerance remains after accounting for the role of department competitiveness.<|eot_id|>",
