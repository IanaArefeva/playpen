The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on having a brother and disease. Having a brother has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of having a brother is 39%. The probability of not having a brother and recovering from the disease is 20%. The probability of having a brother and recovering from the disease is 31%. Is the chance of recovering from the disease larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that having a brother does not increase the chance of recovering from the disease.<|eot_id|>",
