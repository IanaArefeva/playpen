The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 42%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 63%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be less likely to see black hair if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of black hair is higher for those with a college degree or higher (63%) than for those without a college degree (42%), we can conclude that the positive effect of a college degree on black hair is not entirely due to the educational institution's direct influence on black hair. The higher probability of black hair among those with a college degree or higher is likely due to the positive effect of skill on black hair, which is more likely to be present in those with higher educational attainment. If we condition on the absence of a college degree, the skill level of those without a college degree is still higher than that of those with a college degree, which means that the probability of black hair among those without a college degree is still higher than among those with a college degree.||",
