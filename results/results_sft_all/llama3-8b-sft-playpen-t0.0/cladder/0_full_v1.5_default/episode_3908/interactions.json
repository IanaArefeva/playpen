The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 37%. For individuals who have not visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 74%. For individuals who have visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 44%. For individuals who have visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 70%. For individuals who have not visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 6%. For individuals who have not visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 26%. For individuals who have visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 60%. For individuals who have visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 64%. The overall probability of high skill level is 8%. Does having visited England positively affect salary through occupation?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key insight here is that the probability of a high salary is higher for white-collar workers than for blue-collar workers, both in England and outside of it. This suggests that occupation is the primary driver of the positive effect on salary, rather than the visit to England. The visit to England does not directly increase the probability of a white-collar job, which is the occupation that is associated with higher salaries.||",
