For people who have a brother and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 60%. For people who have a brother and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 25%. The overall probability of high pollution is 47%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would having a brother negatively affect lung cancer?",
