The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who cannot swim, the probability of high exam score is 13%. For students who can swim, the probability of high exam score is 73%. Will being able to swim decrease the chance of high exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a high exam score for students who can swim is 73%, which is higher than the 13% probability for students who cannot swim. This positive direct relationship between ability to swim and exam score suggests that being able to swim will increase the chance of a high exam score, rather than decreasing it.||",
