The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 25%. The probability of not liking spicy food and dark room is 22%. The probability of liking spicy food and dark room is 16%. Is the chance of dark room larger when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between liking spicy food and room is not strong enough to change the probability of dark room. The probability of dark room is primarily determined by the joint probability of not liking spicy food and dark room, which is 22%.<|eot_id|>",
