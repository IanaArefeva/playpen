The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 40%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 84%. Will intelligent parents increase the chance of intelligent child?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this world, parents' social status is a more significant predictor of child's intelligence than parents' intelligence. The probability of an intelligent child given intelligent parents is 84%, but this is lower than the 100% probability of an intelligent child given a high social status. Since parents' social status is directly related to child's intelligence, and parents' social status is not directly related to parents' intelligence, the positive effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is counteracted by the negative effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence.||",
