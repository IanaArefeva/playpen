The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how gender correlates with admission status in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to department competitiveness. To understand how gender affects admission status, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The department competitiveness also exerts a direct effect on admission status, which means that the relationship between gender and admission status is not isolated and can be influenced by the intervening variable of department competitiveness. In this case, looking at the relationship between gender and admission status on a case-by-case basis according to department competitiveness (Method 2) can help control for the confounding effect of department competitiveness and provide a more accurate picture of how gender affects admission status.||",
