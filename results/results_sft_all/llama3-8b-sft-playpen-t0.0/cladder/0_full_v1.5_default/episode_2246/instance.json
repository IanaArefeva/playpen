Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 82%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 46%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 48%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 14%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 63%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 68%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 16%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 30%. The overall probability of confounder active is 53%. Does parents' intelligence negatively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?",
