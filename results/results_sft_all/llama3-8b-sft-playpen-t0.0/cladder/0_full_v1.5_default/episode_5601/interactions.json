The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 63%. For patients who pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 27%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 58%. Is thick lips less likely than thin lips overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of thick lips is higher for those who pay a high hospital bill than for those who pay a low hospital bill, which suggests that hospital costs are associated with thick lips. Since hospital costs are a direct cause of hospital bill, and hospital bill is a direct cause of hospital costs, we can conclude that hospital costs are a direct cause of both thick and thin lips. The higher probability of thick lips among those who pay a high hospital bill than among those who pay a low hospital bill further supports this conclusion.||",
