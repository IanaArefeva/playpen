The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 63%. For patients who pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 27%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 58%. Is thick lips less likely than thin lips overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of thick lips is higher for those who pay a high hospital bill than for those who pay a low hospital bill, which suggests that hospital costs are associated with thick lips. Since hospital costs are a direct cause of hospital bill, and hospital bill is a direct cause of hospital costs, we can conclude that hospital costs are a direct cause of both thick and thin lips. The higher probability of thick lips among those who pay a high hospital bill than among those who pay a low hospital bill further supports this conclusion.<|eot_id|>",
