The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 70%. For people who have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 53%. For people who have a brother, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The reduction in the probability of lung cancer from 70% to 53% when having a brother is a result of the direct positive effect of having a brother on lung cancer, which counteracts the direct positive effect of having a brother on smoking and the subsequent direct positive effect of smoking on lung cancer.
