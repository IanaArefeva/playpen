The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The camper has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of the camper lighting a match is 30%. The probability of the camper not lighting a match and the forest on fire is 37%. The probability of the camper lighting a match and the forest on fire is 26%. Is the chance of the forest on fire smaller when observing the camper lighting a match?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since 26% is less than 37%, the chance of the forest on fire is smaller when observing the camper lighting a match.<|eot_id|>",
