Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 43%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 81%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be less likely to see high salary if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that having a college degree or higher directly leads to a higher probability of having a high salary. If we condition on having a college degree or higher, the probability of a high salary remains the same (81%) whether or not the person had a college degree. This is because the college degree is the direct cause of the high salary, and the absence of a college degree does not reduce the probability of a high salary in this condition.<|eot_id|>",
