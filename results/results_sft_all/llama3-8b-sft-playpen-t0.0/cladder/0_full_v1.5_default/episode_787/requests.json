The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 22%. For individuals who are not male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 53%. For individuals who are male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 51%. For individuals who are male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 76%. For individuals who are not male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 32%. For individuals who are not male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 23%. For individuals who are male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 24%. For individuals who are male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 49%. The overall probability of high skill level is 19%. Does gender negatively affect salary through occupation?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between \"gender\" and \"salary\" is not fully specified in the table, and we need to carefully examine the relationships through the mediator \"occupation\" to conclude whether \"gender\" has a negative effect on \"salary\" through \"occupation\".\nGiven that the direct relationship between \"gender\" and \"salary\" is not fully specified, we need to consider the relationships through the mediator \"occupation\" to conclude whether \"gender\" has a negative effect on \"salary\" through \"occupation\".\nThe table does not provide direct information about the relationship between \"gender\" and \"salary\" outside of the occupation mediator.
