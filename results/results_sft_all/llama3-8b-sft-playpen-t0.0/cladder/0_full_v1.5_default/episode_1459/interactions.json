The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 74%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 21%. For husbands that set the alarm, would it be less likely to see ringing alarm if the husband had not set the alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that setting the alarm actually decreases the likelihood of the alarm clock ringing, from 74% to 21%. If the husband had not set the alarm, the probability of the alarm clock ringing would still be 74%, which is higher than the 21% probability when the husband sets the alarm.||",
