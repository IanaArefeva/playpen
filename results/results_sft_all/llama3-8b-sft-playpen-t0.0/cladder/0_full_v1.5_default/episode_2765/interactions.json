The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of clean water is 22%. For people with only polluted water, the probability of cholera contraction is 57%. For people with access to clean water, the probability of cholera contraction is 79%. Is cholera contraction less likely than cholera prevention overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 78% of the population (100% - 22%) faces a 57% chance of cholera, which is higher than the 79% chance of cholera for those with clean water. Since the probability of clean water is lower than the probability of clean water among those who contract cholera, it is more likely that someone will contract cholera than that someone will have clean water and not contract cholera.||",
