Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 56%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 70%. Will college degree or higher decrease the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This indicates that having a college degree or higher actually increases the chance of a high salary, rather than decreasing it.<|eot_id|>",
