Appearance has a direct effect on relationship status. For people in a relationship, the correlation between liking spicy food and attractive appearance is 0.33. If we look at people in a relationship, does it mean that liking spicy food does not affect attractive appearance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The absence of a direct relationship between the two variables in the context of being in a relationship does not preclude the possibility of a direct relationship between them in general. The condition only describes the joint behavior of the two variables in the specific subpopulation of people already in a relationship, not their behavior outside of this subpopulation.<|eot_id|>",
