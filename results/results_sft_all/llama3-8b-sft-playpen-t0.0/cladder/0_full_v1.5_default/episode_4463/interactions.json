The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 15%. The probability of not listening to jazz and lung cancer is 30%. The probability of listening to jazz and lung cancer is 6%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing listening to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In comparison, the probability of lung cancer given no jazz is 0.5 (30% / 60%). The direct relationship between pollution and lung cancer is also not strong, as the probability of lung cancer given no jazz is 0.5, which is the same as the probability of lung cancer given no pollution. The direct relationship between smoke and lung cancer is strong, as the probability of lung cancer given smoke is 1. The overall probability of lung cancer is 0.5 (30% / 60%). The direct relationship between smoke and lung cancer is the most direct and strong relationship in this system, and the probability of smoke is not directly related to the probability of lung cancer.||",
