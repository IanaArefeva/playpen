The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that waking up late or heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is no traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school late if waking up late instead of waking up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The absence of traffic on the road further solidifies the direct link between her wake-up time and school arrival. Since we already know that she typically wakes up on time and there is no traffic, we can conclude that she will still arrive at school on time, even if she wakes up late. The condition of no traffic on the road acts as a control variable, neutralizing the potential impact of late wake-up on her school arrival.||",
