The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 50%. The probability of high school degree or lower and high salary is 30%. The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 7%. Is the chance of high salary larger when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both education level and salary, and the probability of college degree or higher is 50%, the positive effect of college degree on high salary is counterbalanced by the negative effect of unobserved confounders on high salary. This balance leads to the same probability of high salary in both groups (with and without college degree), which is 30%.<|eot_id|>",
