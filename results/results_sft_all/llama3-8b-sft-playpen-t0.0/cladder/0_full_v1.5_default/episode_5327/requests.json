The probability of not liking spicy food and having a high salary is 40%, which is higher than the probability of liking spicy food and having a high salary (4%). This suggests that not liking spicy food is associated with a higher chance of having a high salary, which in turn means that the chance of high salary is larger when not observing liking spicy food.<|eot_id|>",
