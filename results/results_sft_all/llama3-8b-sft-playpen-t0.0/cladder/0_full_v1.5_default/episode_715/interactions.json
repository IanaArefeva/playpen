The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 51%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 21%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 56%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 10%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 48%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 67%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect admission status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of admission acceptance for women is lower than that for men in both competitive and non-competitive departments. In the competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance for women is 21%, while for men it is 10%. In the non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance for women is 51%, while for men it is 56%. This indicates that being male has a positive direct effect on admission status, while being female has a negative direct effect.||",
