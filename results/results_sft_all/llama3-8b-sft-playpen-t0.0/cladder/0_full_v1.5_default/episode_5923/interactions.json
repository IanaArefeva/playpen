The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and freckles. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on freckles. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of freckles is 54%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of freckles is 41%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of clean water is 56%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of clean water is 26%. Will clean water increase the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the positive relationship between water quality and freckles is offset by the negative relationship between water quality and the condition that leads to freckles (in this case, the unobserved condition of \"poverty\" which likely has a negative effect on water quality and a positive effect on freckles).||",
