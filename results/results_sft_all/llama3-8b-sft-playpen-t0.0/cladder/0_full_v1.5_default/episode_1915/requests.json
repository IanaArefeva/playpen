The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 89%. For people considered unattractive and are not famous, the probability of talent is 99%. For people considered unattractive and are famous, the probability of talent is 97%. For people considered attractive and are not famous, the probability of talent is 99%. For people considered attractive and are famous, the probability of talent is 57%. If we look at people who are famous, does the chance of talent decrease when attractive appearance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This difference in probability directly answers the question, showing that the chance of talent does not decrease when attractive appearance is present among famous people.<|eot_id|>",
