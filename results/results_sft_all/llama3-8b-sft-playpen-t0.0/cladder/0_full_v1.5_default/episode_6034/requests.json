The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. We know that having a brother causes having smallpox and no vaccine reaction. having smallpox or severe vaccination reaction causes smallpox survival. Would the person survives smallpox if having a brother instead of not having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since having smallpox or a severe vaccine reaction is a direct cause of smallpox survival, and the person in this case has both smallpox and no vaccine reaction, we can conclude that the person will not survive smallpox.<|eot_id|>",
