The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 32%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 73%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 4%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 37%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 55%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 24%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 83%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 57%. The overall probability of good health is 6%. Does having a sister negatively affect infant mortality through infant's birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between having a sister and infant's birth weight is not clear from the given information. The probability of normal birth weight is higher for those with a sister than without one, but this does not directly imply a negative effect on infant mortality through birth weight. The key insight is that the positive effect of having a sister on birth weight is offset by the negative effect of having a sister on health condition, which in turn affects birth weight and infant mortality.||",
