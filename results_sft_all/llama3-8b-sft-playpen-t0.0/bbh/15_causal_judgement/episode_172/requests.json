The boss tells them both: \"Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time.\" Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off.

Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy.

The grid is filled with X's in every cell except for the middle column, which is empty. The grid is then used as a pattern to create a second grid. The second grid is identical to the first grid except for the middle column, which is filled with X's in every cell. The second grid is then used to create a third grid. The third grid is identical to the second grid except for the middle column, which is empty in every cell. The third grid is then used to create a fourth grid. The fourth grid is identical to the third grid except for the middle column, which is filled with X's in every cell. The fourth grid is then used to create a fifth grid. The fifth grid is identical to the fourth grid except for the middle column, which is empty in every cell. The fifth grid is then used to create a target grid.
