Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: No\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nSuzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: \"Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time.\" Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nGeorge and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nLouie and Claire are playing a game of basketball, and they made a bet with their friends who are watching on the sidelines. If either Louie makes a 3-point shot or Claire makes a 3-point shot during the game, then they'll win $100 and split it down the middle. Just when the game started, Claire immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. She looked to the basket, focused her shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie, Claire, and their friends continued playing, but as hard as they tried, Louie and Claire couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because they would win $100 if either Louie made a 3-point shot or Claire made a 3- point shot, Louie and Claire won $100 and split it down the middle. Think about what could have been different in the story that you just read. Which event do you imagine happening differently: Claire making the 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie making the 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Did Louie and Claire win the $100 bet because Louie made the 3-point shot?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
