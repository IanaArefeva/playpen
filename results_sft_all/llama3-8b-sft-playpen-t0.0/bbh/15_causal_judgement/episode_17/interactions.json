The boss tells them both: \"Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time.\" Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nGeorge and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJoe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior stems from his talkativeness. He is the type of person who likes to talk to anybody, at any time. Sometimes his friends are bothered by this seemingly excessive talkativeness and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized that Joe's talkativeness was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did the neighbor cause injury to Joe's son?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA:",

The grid is filled with X's in every other column, except for the rightmost column, which is entirely empty. The grid is then folded along the vertical line of X's, creating a symmetrical pattern. The folded grid is then used to create a pattern on a new grid, where the X's from the folded grid are placed in the corresponding positions on the new grid. The new grid is then used to create a pattern on a third grid, where the X's from the new grid are placed in the corresponding positions on the third grid. The third grid is then used to create a pattern on a fourth grid, where the X's from the third grid are placed in the corresponding positions on the fourth grid. The fourth grid is then used to create a pattern on a fifth grid, where the X's from the fourth grid are placed in the corresponding positions on the fifth grid. The fifth grid is then used to create a pattern on a sixth grid, where the X's from the fifth grid are placed in the corresponding positions on the sixth grid. The pattern on the sixth grid is a vertical line of X's in the middle column, with empty cells in every other column.
