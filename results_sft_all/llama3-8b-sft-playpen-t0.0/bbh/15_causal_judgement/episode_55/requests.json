He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy.

The grid is filled with X's and ▢'s in a pattern that looks like a cross. The child is then given a blank grid and is asked to place an X in the center of the grid. The child places the X in the center of the grid, and the grid now looks like a cross. The child then places an X in the top center of the grid, and the grid now looks like a cross with an additional X in the top center. The child then places an X in the bottom center of the grid, and the grid now looks like a cross with additional X's in the top center and bottom center. Finally, the child places an X in the middle of the right column, and the grid now looks like a cross with additional X's in the top center, bottom center, and middle of the right column.
