The boss tells them both: \"Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time.\" Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am.

Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy.

The building's climate control system is a new design that saves energy by keeping track of the number of people in the building, and only turning on when enough people have entered the building. The climate control system will turn on when the people who work at the travel agency or the people who work in the design studio arrive for work. Each office has enough employees to turn on the climate control system on their own. The travel agency employees almost always arrive at 8:45am, but the design studio employees almost always arrive at 10 am. Today, the travel agency employees arrived at 8:45 am. Unexpectedly, the design studio employees also arrived at 8:45 am to meet a deadline. So, today, the climate control system turned on at 8:45 am. Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
