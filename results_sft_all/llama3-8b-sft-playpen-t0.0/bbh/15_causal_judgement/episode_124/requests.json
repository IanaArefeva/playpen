Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild.

Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: No\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nSuzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: \"Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time.\" Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off.

Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nDavid has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is set on HIGH. He does not change the setting at all, and he leaves the temperature set to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Lena immediately administers the EpiPen and the girl's condition begins to stabilize.
