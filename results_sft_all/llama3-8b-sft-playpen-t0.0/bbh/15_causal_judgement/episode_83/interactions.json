Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nImagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition.

So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights and pulls the trigger-thereby killing the deer. Unfortunately, the bullet exited the deer's body and struck a hunter who was hiding nearby. Did the man intentionally shoot the hunter?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA:",

The plan involves a 5 am start, a 3.5 hour drive, and a 1.5 hour rest stop along the way. The plan is carefully followed, and you end up in the nearby city exactly on time. A weather forecast before you left indicated that there would be a 5 am fog bank in your hometown, which would clear by the time you reached the nearby city. The fog bank was so thick that you could not have made the trip without it. In your mind, you attribute the fog bank's clearing to the weather forecast you saw before you left.
