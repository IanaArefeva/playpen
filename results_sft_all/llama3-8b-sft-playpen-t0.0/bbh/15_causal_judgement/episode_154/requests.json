Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: No\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nSuzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: \"Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time.\" Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nGeorge and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nEugene and Tina were a young married couple who lived in the country. Both were partially paralyzed and confined to wheelchairs. They had met four years before when Tina was a counsellor with the Canadian Paraplegic Association, had fallen in love, and were married one year later. On this particular evening, Eugene had phoned to request a cab to take them downtown. When the taxi driver arrived, Eugene and Tina were waiting by the street. On seeing that they were both in wheelchairs, the taxi driver refused their fare because he thought it would be too crowded in the taxi with both of them and the wheelchairs. So the taxi driver headed back downtown without them. Because there was no time to call another cab, Eugene and Tina took Tina's car, which was equipped with special hand controls. In order to get downtown from their house, they had to travel across a bridge over Rupert River. A severe storm the night before had weakened the structure of the bridge. About 5 minutes before Eugene and Tina reached it, a section of the bridge collapsed. The taxi driver had reached the bridge shortly before them, and had driven off the collapsed bridge. He barely managed to escape from his taxi before it sank in the river. In the dark, Eugene and Tina drove off the collapsed bridge and their car plummeted into the river below. They both drowned. Their bodies were retrieved from the car the next morning. Did the taxi driver's refusal to take Eugene and Tina cause their death?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
