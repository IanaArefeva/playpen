The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian.

The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To start with, every rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap is a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo. Now, being a rare consumer of Camay soap is necessary for being a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap. Moreover, not every infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo is both a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Camay soap.
