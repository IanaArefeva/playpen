The following argument pertains to this question: First, we have the following two premises: (1) every grandchild of Ward is a grandchild of Paul; (2) every grandchild of Ward is a grandchild of Earl. From these two premises, we conclude that every grandchild of Ward is a grandchild of both Paul and Earl. This is a formal fallacy, as we have made an illicit assumption that the grandchild of Ward is the same person in both premises, which is not the case. The correct conclusion should be that every grandchild of Ward is a grandchild of both Paul and Earl, but we do not know whether this grandchild is the same person in both cases. The correct formal fallacy is the illicit assumption of identicality between the grandchild of Ward in the two premises, which is not supported by the premises.
