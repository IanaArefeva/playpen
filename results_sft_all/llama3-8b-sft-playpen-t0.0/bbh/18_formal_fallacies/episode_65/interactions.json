The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid\n- invalid\nA: valid\n\nQ: \"It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid\n- invalid\nA: valid\n\nQ: \"It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products.

No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap.

Second premise: It is false that Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core. Third premise: Every ingredient of Charged Up Cherry is neither an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core nor an ingredient of Nobility.
