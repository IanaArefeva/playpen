The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not listen to jazz and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 31%. For people who do not listen to jazz and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 78%. For people who listen to jazz and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 35%. For people who listen to jazz and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For people who do not listen to jazz and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 4%. For people who do not listen to jazz and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 31%. For people who listen to jazz and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 24%. For people who listen to jazz and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 66%. The overall probability of high pollution is 58%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would listening to jazz positively affect lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
