The candle has a direct effect on room. We know that blowing out the candle and candle with wax causes dark room. We observed the candle is out of wax. Would the room is bright if not blowing out the candle instead of blowing out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
