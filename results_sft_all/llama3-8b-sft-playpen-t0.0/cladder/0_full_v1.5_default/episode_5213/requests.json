The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of male gender is 3%. The probability of non-male gender and being lactose intolerant is 66%. The probability of male gender and being lactose intolerant is 1%. Is the chance of being lactose intolerant larger when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, the probability of being lactose intolerant is primarily determined by the direct relationship between being a male and being lactose intolerant, which is not strong. The direct relationship between male gender and being lactose intolerant is not as influential as the direct relationship between being a male and having a lower probability of being lactose intolerant, which is 1% compared to the 3% probability of being male. The direct relationship between male gender and being lactose intolerant is not as strong as the direct relationship between being a male and having a lower probability of being lactose intolerant, which is 1% compared to the 3% probability of being male.<|eot_id|>",
