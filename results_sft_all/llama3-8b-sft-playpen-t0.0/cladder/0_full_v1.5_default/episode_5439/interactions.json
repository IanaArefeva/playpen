The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 43%. For people who do not play card games and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 72%. For people who play card games and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 74%. For people who play card games and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 93%. For people who do not play card games and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 79%. For people who do not play card games and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 50%. For people who play card games and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 52%. For people who play card games and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 20%. The overall probability of smoker is 85%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would playing card games negatively affect lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having diabetes is higher for those who play card games and are nonsmokers (52%) than for those who do not play card games and are nonsmokers (79%). This suggests that card game play might have a positive effect on the probability of having diabetes, which in turn could lead to a positive effect on the probability of long lifespan.||",
