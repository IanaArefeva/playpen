Since the person has diabetes, we can conclude that the person's diabetes is likely caused by their smoking. Additionally, we know that having diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan, and that the person's having diabetes is likely caused by their smoking. Since the person is a smoker and has diabetes, we can conclude that the person's long lifespan is likely caused by their smoking rather than their ability to speak English. If the person were not speaking English, we would still conclude that their long lifespan is likely caused by their smoking, not by their language ability.<|eot_id|>",
