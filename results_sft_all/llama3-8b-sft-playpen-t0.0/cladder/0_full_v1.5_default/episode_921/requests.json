The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 17%. The probability of nonsmoking and college admission is 50%. The probability of smoking and college admission is 2%. Is the chance of college admission smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In fact, the probability of college admission is higher when not smoking (50%) than when smoking (2%). The direct relationship between effort and college admission is also not strong, as the specific details about the relationship between effort and college admission are not provided. The direct relationship between smoking and college admission is not strong, and the probability of college admission is higher when not smoking than when smoking, so the chance of college admission is not smaller when observing smoking.<|eot_id|>",
