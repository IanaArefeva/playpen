The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 43%. For people refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 29%. For people getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 73%. Is recovering from the disease less likely than dying from the disease overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key insight here is that the probability of recovering from the disease is higher for those who get the vaccine (73%) than for those who refuse the vaccine (29%). This directly implies that, overall, the probability of recovering from the disease is higher than the probability of dying from the disease, since the vaccine directly affects the disease and the probability of recovery is higher for those who get the vaccine.||",
