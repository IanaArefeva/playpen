The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. Method 1: We look at how Alice waking up correlates with rainfall case by case according to traffic. Method 2: We look directly at how Alice waking up correlates with rainfall in general. To understand how Alice waking up affects rainfall, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since there are no additional confounding variables or mediating relationships involved, looking at the direct general relationship between Alice's wakefulness and rainfall (Method 2) is more appropriate and likely to yield a more accurate result than examining the relationship through the lens of traffic (Method 1).<|eot_id|>",
