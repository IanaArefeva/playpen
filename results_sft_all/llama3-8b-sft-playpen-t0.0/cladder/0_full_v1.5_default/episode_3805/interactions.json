The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. Method 1: We look directly at how ability to swim correlates with exam score in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to studying habit. To understand how ability to swim affects exam score, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the relationship between ability to swim and exam score is not direct, but rather indirect through the studying habit. In this case, looking at the relationship between ability to swim and exam score case by case according to studying habit (Method 2) is more appropriate than looking at the general relationship between the two (Method 1), as it controls for the intermediate variable and provides a more accurate representation of the direct relationship between ability to swim and exam score.||",
