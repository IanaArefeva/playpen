The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 85%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 59%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 84%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 74%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 29%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In particular, for smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 58% with high tar deposit and 84% with no tar deposit, which means that the reduction in lung cancer risk associated with high tar deposit is more than offset by the reduction in lung cancer risk associated with being a smoker. This suggests that the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is not as strong as the direct effect of tar deposit on lung cancer, and that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is primarily mediated through the intervening variable of tar deposit.||",
