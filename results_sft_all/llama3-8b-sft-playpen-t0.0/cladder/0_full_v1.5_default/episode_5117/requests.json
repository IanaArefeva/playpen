The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 98%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 64%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 79%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The given probabilities of high salary for those with and without a brother (79% and 64%, respectively) already account for the intervening variable of skill. Since the probability of having a brother is 98%, the vast majority of the population will have a brother, which in turn will lead to a higher probability of having a high salary (79%). This does not imply that having a brother directly affects the likelihood of having a high or low salary; rather, it's the skill acquired through having a brother that ultimately affects the salary.<|eot_id|>",
