The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 86%. For people considered unattractive and are not famous, the probability of talent is 92%. For people considered unattractive and are famous, the probability of talent is 81%. For people considered attractive and are not famous, the probability of talent is 90%. For people considered attractive and are famous, the probability of talent is 77%. If we look at people who are famous, does the chance of talent increase when attractive appearance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To answer this question, we need to condition on the event that the person is famous. Once we condition on this event, we can examine the relationship between attractiveness and talent.\nGiven that we are focusing on famous people, we can directly look at the probability of talent among famous people who are attractive and those who are unattractive. The probability of talent among famous people who are unattractive is 81%, and the probability of talent among famous people who are attractive is 77%. Since 77% is less than 81%, we conclude that the chance of talent does not increase when attractiveness is present among famous people.\nThis result might initially appear counterintuitive, as one might expect that being attractive would lead to higher talent among famous people. However, this conclusion is based on the specific relationships and probabilities established in the given world, which do not support this expectation.<|eot_id|>",
