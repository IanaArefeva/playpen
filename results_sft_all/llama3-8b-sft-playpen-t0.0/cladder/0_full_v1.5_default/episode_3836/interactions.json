The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of male gender is 44%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 46%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 67%. Is being allergic to peanuts less likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional information that male gender is more common than female (44% vs 56%) further solidifies this relationship. Since the direct effect of male gender on the probability of being allergic to peanuts is positive, and this relationship is not offset by any counteracting forces in the system, we can conclude that being male is associated with a higher likelihood of having a peanut allergy.||",
