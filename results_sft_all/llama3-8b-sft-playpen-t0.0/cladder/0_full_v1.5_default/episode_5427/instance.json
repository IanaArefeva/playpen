For smokers and are lazy, the probability of freckles is 90%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of freckles is 45%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 40%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 79%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking positively affect freckles?",
