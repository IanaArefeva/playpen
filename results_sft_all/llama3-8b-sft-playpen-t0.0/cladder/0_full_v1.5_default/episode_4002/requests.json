The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 46%. For children who do not like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 35%. For children who like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 70%. Is intelligent child more likely than unintelligent child overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The parents' social status also has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Since the probability of intelligent child is higher for children who like spicy food (70%) than for children who do not like spicy food (35%), it might initially seem like intelligent child is more likely than unintelligent child. However, we must consider the overall probability of liking spicy food (46%) and its impact on parents' social status, which in turn affects child's intelligence. If the parents' social status is higher when children like spicy food, this could lead to a higher probability of intelligent child overall, counteracting the direct effect of liking spicy food on child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
