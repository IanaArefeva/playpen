The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 91%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 83%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 56%. Is scurvy more likely than no scurvy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of citrus consumption is 91%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction: (0.91 * 0.56) + (0.09 * 0.83) = 0.5094 + 0.00747 = 0.51687. This is less than 0.5, which means that scurvy is less likely than no scurvy overall.<|eot_id|>",
