For individuals who are male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 29%. For individuals who are male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 74%. For individuals who are not male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 39%. For individuals who are not male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 29%. For individuals who are male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 83%. For individuals who are male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 75%. The overall probability of high skill level is 14%. If we disregard the mediation effect through occupation, would gender positively affect salary?",
