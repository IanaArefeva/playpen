The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 59%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 67%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 25%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high salary is higher for those without a college degree (67%) than for those with a college degree or higher (25%). This suggests that the positive effect of college degree on high salary is offset by the negative effect of unobserved confounders on both college degree and high salary. The overall probability of high salary is still higher than that of low salary, which is 16% (100% - 84% - 25%).<|eot_id|>",
