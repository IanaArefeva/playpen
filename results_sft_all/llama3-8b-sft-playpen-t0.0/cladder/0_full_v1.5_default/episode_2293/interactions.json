The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 88%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 67%. Will smoking increase the chance of college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of effort on college admission is positive, as more effort typically leads to higher chances of college admission. Since the direct effect of smoking on college admission is negative, it counteracts the positive direct effect of effort on college admission, leading to a lower probability of college admission for smokers compared to nonsmokers.||",
