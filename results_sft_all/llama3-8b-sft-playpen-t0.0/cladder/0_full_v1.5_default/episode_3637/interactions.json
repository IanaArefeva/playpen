The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Lip thickness has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 60%. For people considered unattractive and are not famous, the probability of thick lips is 12%. For people considered unattractive and are famous, the probability of thick lips is 31%. For people considered attractive and are not famous, the probability of thick lips is 9%. For people considered attractive and are famous, the probability of thick lips is 23%. If we look at people who are famous, does the chance of thick lips increase when attractive appearance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
