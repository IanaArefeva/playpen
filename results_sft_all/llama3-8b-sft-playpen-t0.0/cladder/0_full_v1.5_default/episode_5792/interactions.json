The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 80%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 3%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 57%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 18%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 59%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 22%. The overall probability of smoking is 75%. Will smoking decrease the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between smoking and freckles is not clear from the given information. The probability of freckles among smokers is higher than among nonsmokers in the scenarios where the tar deposit is the same (59% for smokers with no tar deposit vs. 57% for nonsmokers with no tar deposit), which suggests that smoking might increase the chance of freckles.||",
