The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 51%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 21%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 56%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 10%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 48%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 67%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect admission status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of admission acceptance for women is lower than that for men in both competitive and non-competitive departments. In the competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance for women is 21%, while for men it is 10%. In the non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance for women is 51%, while for men it is 56%. This indicates that being male has a positive direct effect on admission status, while being female has a negative direct effect.<|eot_id|>",
