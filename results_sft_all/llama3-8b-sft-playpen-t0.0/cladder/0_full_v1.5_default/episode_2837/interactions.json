The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. We know that the captain's order to execute the prisoner causes the corporal shooting and the private shooting. the corporal shooting and the private shooting causes the prisoner's death. Would the prisoner is alive if the captain's order to execute the prisoner instead of the captain's order to release the prisoner?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The corporal and the private's actions are not dependent on the captain's order being an order to execute or an order to release; rather, they are directly caused by the captain's actions.
