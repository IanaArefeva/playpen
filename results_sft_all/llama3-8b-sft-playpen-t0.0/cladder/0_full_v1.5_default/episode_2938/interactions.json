The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. We know that encouragement causes lack of studying. encouragement and studying hard causes high exam score. Would the student has a high exam score if discouragement instead of encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the absence of encouragement, the direct positive effect on exam score is lost, and the only remaining positive effect is through the studying habits, which are also directly counteracted by the encouragement. In the case of discouragement, the direct positive effect on exam score is lost, and the only remaining positive effect is through the studying habits, which are also directly counteracted by the encouragement. In both scenarios, the direct positive effect on exam score is lost, and the only remaining positive effect is through the studying habits, which are also directly counteracted by the encouragement.||",
