For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 84%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 37%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 71%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 49%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 82%. The overall probability of smoking is 47%.
