The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 32%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 84%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 37%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 71%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 49%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 82%. The overall probability of smoking is 47%. Does smoking positively affect peanut allergy through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

To establish whether smoking has a positive effect on peanut allergy through tar deposit, we need to examine the joint effect of smoking and high tar deposit on the probability of being allergic to peanuts.\nGiven that the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 37% for nonsmokers and 49% for smokers when there is no tar deposit, we can conclude that smoking has a direct positive effect on the probability of being allergic to peanuts.\nHowever, when we consider the joint effect of smoking and high tar deposit on the probability of being allergic to peanuts, we see that the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 71% for nonsmokers and 82% for smokers. This suggests that the positive effect of smoking on the probability of being allergic to peanuts is not fully accounted for by the intervening variable of tar deposit.\nIn particular, the increase in the probability of being allergic to peanuts from 37% to 71% for nonsmokers when moving from no tar deposit to high tar deposit is a result of the direct effect of high tar deposit on the probability of being allergic to peanuts, rather than a result of the positive effect of smoking on the probability of being allergic to peanuts through tar deposit.\nTherefore, we conclude that the positive effect of smoking on the probability of being allergic to peanuts is not fully accounted for by the intervening variable of tar deposit, and that the",
