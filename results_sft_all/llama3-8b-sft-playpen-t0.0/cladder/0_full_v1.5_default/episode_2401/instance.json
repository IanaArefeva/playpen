Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 92%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 61%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 36%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 6%. The overall probability of male gender is 55%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?",
