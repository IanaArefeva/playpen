The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 92%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 61%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 36%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 6%. The overall probability of male gender is 55%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the direct effect of male gender on recovery is more pronounced when male patients are not receiving treatment. In the absence of any other intervening variables, we can conclude that male patients who are not receiving treatment are more likely to recover than male patients who are receiving treatment.<|eot_id|>",
