Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 8%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin death is 72%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin death is 24%. Is penguin death more likely than penguin lives overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of taking the elevator is 8%, the overall probability of penguin death is (0.08 * 0.24) + (0.92 * 0.72) = 0.1852. The probability of penguin lives is 1 - 0.1852 = 0.8148. Since 0.8148 is greater than 0.1852, penguin death is less likely than penguin lives overall.<|eot_id|>",
