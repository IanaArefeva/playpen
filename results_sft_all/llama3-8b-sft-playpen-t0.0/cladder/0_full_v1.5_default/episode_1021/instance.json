  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 70%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 54%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 38%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 72%. Will increased supply increase the chance of increased price?",
