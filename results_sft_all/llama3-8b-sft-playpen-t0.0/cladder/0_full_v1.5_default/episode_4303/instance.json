Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 7%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 18%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 80%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 91%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 53%.
