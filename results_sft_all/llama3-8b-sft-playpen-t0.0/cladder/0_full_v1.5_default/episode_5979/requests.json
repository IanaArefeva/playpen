Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. We know that full moon causes rain and sprinkler on. rain and sprinkler on causes wet ground. Would the ground is dry if no full moon instead of full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the sprinkler is always on in this world, it will always lead to a wet ground, rain or no rain. The full moon's effect on rain is not necessary for the ground to be wet, as the sprinkler's direct effect on the ground is sufficient to ensure it remains wet.<|eot_id|>",
