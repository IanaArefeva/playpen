Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. We know that full moon causes rain and sprinkler off. rain and sprinkler on causes wet ground.

The absence of a full moon means that there will be no rain, and without rain, the ground will not be wet. Additionally, the absence of a full moon also means that the sprinkler will be on, and the on state of the sprinkler directly affects the ground, leading to a wet ground.<|eot_id|>",
