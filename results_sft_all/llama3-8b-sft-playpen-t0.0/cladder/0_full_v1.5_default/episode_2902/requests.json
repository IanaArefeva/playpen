The direct relationship between medication and heart condition is that medication leads to a healthy heart, and the person is already taking medication, which means they already have a healthy heart. The chain of causality is: medication -> high blood pressure (not a direct cause of heart condition) -> healthy heart. If the person were not taking medication, they would not have high blood pressure, and without high blood pressure, they would not have a healthy heart. In that case, the person would likely experience heart problems.<|eot_id|>",
