The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 88%. For people who do not have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 45%. For people who have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 58%. For people who have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 13%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of alarm set by wife is 9%. For people who have a brother, the probability of alarm set by wife is 64%. Does having a brother negatively affect alarm clock through wife?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is higher when the person has a brother and the wife sets the alarm (13%) than when the person does not have a brother and the wife sets the alarm (45%). This suggests that having a brother might have a positive effect on the probability of the alarm clock ringing, rather than a negative one.||",
