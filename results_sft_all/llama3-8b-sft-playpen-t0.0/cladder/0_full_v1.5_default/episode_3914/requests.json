The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of having visited England is 48%. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 53%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 78%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The unobserved skill variable likely exerts a strong influence on both occupation and salary. Since skill is unobserved, we must consider the joint effects of having visited England and the skill variable on occupation and salary. The direct relationship between having visited England and high salary is not strong enough to counteract the likely positive effect of the unobserved skill variable on high salary. The probability of high salary for those who have not visited England is 53%, which is higher than the 48% probability of having visited England. This suggests that the unobserved skill variable likely exerts a positive effect on high salary, which could offset the positive effect of having visited England.<|eot_id|>",
