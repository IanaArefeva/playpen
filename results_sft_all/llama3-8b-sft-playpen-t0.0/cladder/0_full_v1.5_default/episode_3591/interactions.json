The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 26%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 49%. Will having a sister increase the chance of healthy heart?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is also a direct one, and blood pressure is likely to be higher in people who have a sister, given the direct effect of having a sister on blood pressure. Since the probability of a healthy heart is higher in people who have a sister (49%) than in those who do not (26%), it might appear that having a sister would increase the chance of a healthy heart. However, this conclusion overlooks the intervening variable of blood pressure. In this world, the direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition is offset by the higher blood pressure associated with having a sister, which in turn affects heart condition. This means that the positive effect of having a sister on heart condition is likely to be counteracted by the negative effect of higher blood pressure, leading to a net decrease in the chance of a healthy heart for those who have a sister.||",
