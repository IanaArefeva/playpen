The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 59%. The probability of high school degree or lower and high salary is 16%. The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 42%. Is the chance of high salary smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 42%, which is higher than the probability of high school degree or lower and high salary (16%). This suggests that having a college degree or higher is associated with a higher chance of having a high salary, rather than a lower chance.<|eot_id|>",
