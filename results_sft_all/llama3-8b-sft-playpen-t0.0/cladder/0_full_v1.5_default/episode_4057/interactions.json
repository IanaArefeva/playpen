The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 96%. For people who do not speak english and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 54%. For people who speak english and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 92%. For people who speak english and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 60%. For people who do not speak english and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 25%. For people who do not speak english and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 55%. For people who speak english and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 59%. For people who speak english and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 80%. The overall probability of smoker is 18%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would ability to speak english positively affect lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of long lifespan is higher for those who speak English than for those who do not, but this could be due to the mediating effect of diabetes rather than a direct effect of English language skills on lifespan. The direct relationship between English language skills and lifespan is not isolated from the effects of diabetes, which is also directly related to both English language skills and lifespan.||",
