The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. Method 1: We look at how drinking coffee correlates with alarm clock case by case according to wife. Method 2: We look directly at how drinking coffee correlates with alarm clock in general. To understand how drinking coffee affects alarm clock, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The wife's behavior is an intervening variable that affects the alarm clock, but it does not directly link coffee consumption to the alarm clock. Since the direct relationship between coffee and alarm clock is not subject to the intervening variable of the wife, we should look at the general correlation between coffee and alarm clock to understand the direct effect of coffee on the alarm clock.||",
