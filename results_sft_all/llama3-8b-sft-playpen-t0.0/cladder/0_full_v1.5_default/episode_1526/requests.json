The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 23%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 79%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 40%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the manager not signing the letter and the employee being fired is 0.77 * 0.79 = 0.61. The probability of the manager not signing the letter and the employee not being fired is 0.77 * (1 - 0.79) = 0.16. The probability of the manager signing the letter and the employee being fired is 0.23 * 0.40 = 0.092. The probability of the manager signing the letter and the employee not being fired is 0.23 * (1 - 0.40) = 0.137. The total probability of the employee being fired is 0.61 + 0.092 = 0.702. The total probability of the employee not being fired is 0.16 + 0.137 = 0.297. Since 0.702 is greater than 0.297, the probability of the employee being fired is higher than the probability of the employee not being fired.<|eot_id|>",
