Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 47%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 63%.

The probability of long lifespan is higher for card game players (63%) than for non-players (47%), which might imply a positive relationship. However, the direct relationship between card game play and long lifespan is not established, and the intervening variable of diabetes could play a role in this relationship.
