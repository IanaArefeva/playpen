The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 34%. For children who do not like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 30%. For children who like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 73%. For children who like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 64%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 62%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 80%. For children who like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 48%. For children who like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 64%. The overall probability of confounder active is 56%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would liking spicy food negatively affect child's intelligence?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This positive direct effect supersedes any potential negative effects that might be present in the system, and it is not offset by the unobserved confounder, which does not directly influence child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
