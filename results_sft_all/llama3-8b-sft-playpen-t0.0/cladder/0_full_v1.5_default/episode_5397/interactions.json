The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 86%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 47%. Will intelligent parents increase the chance of being lactose intolerant?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of being lactose intolerant is higher for children with unintelligent parents (86%) than for children with intelligent parents (47%). This suggests that the children's lactose intolerance is more closely associated with their parents' social status than with their parents' intelligence. Since parents' social status has a direct effect on their children's lactose intolerance, and intelligent parents are likely to have higher social status, it is more likely that children of intelligent parents will have lower probability of being lactose intolerant.||",
