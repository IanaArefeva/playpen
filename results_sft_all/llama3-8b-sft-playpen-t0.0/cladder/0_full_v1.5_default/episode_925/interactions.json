The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 77%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 37%. Will smoking decrease the chance of college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, this negative direct effect is offset by the positive direct effect of effort on college admission. Since smoking has a direct negative effect on effort, and effort has a direct positive effect on college admission, the overall effect of smoking on college admission is still positive. This is because the reduction in college admission probability due to the direct negative effect of smoking on college admission is more than offset by the reduction in college admission probability that would have occurred if the individual had made less effort and still smoked.||",
