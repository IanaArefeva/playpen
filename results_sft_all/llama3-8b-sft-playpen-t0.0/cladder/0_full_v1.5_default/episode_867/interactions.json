The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 21%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 25%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 81%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 83%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 55%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 30%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 33%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 73%. The overall probability of confounder active is 56%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is still present, as seen in the differences in child's intelligence between children with intelligent parents and those with unintelligent parents, even when controlling for parents' social status. The probability of intelligent child is higher for children with intelligent parents than for children with unintelligent parents, both in the case of high and low parents' social status. This suggests that there is a direct causal link between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence that is not fully accounted for by parents' social status.||",
