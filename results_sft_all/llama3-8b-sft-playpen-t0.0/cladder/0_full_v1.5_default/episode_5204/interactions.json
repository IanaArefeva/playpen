The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. The overall probability of encouragement is 91%. The probability of discouragement and brown eyes is 7%. The probability of encouragement and brown eyes is 58%. Is the chance of brown eyes smaller when observing encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since encouragement directly affects studying habits and studying habits directly affects brown eyes, we need to consider the joint effect of encouragement and studying habits on brown eyes. The probability of brown eyes given encouragement is 58%, and the probability of brown eyes given studying habits is not directly provided, but we can infer it from the given information. The probability of brown eyes is 7%, and the probability of encouragement is 91%. This means that the joint probability of brown eyes and encouragement is 58%. If we condition on encouragement, the probability of brown eyes remains the same as the joint probability of brown eyes and encouragement, which is 58%. This is because the direct relationship between encouragement and brown eyes is already accounted for in the joint probability. The studying habits intervening between encouragement and brown eyes do not change the probability of brown eyes given encouragement.||",
