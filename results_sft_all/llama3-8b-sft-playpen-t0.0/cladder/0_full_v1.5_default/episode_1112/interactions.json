The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 6%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 16%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 79%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 90%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 49%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\nLet's first consider the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone not receiving treatment. In this case, the probability of recovery is 6%. Now, if we condition on the patient not having a large kidney stone (with probability 51%), we can conclude that the probability of having a small kidney stone is 0.5 (1 - 0.5). This means that the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone not receiving treatment is the same as the counterfactual of a patient not having a large kidney stone and not receiving treatment.\nNext, we need to consider the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone receiving treatment. In this case, the probability of recovery is 16%. Since the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone not receiving treatment is the same as the counterfactual of a patient not having a large kidney stone and not receiving treatment, we can conclude that the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone not receiving treatment is the same as the counterfactual of a patient not having a large kidney stone and not receiving treatment.\nNow, we need to consider the counterfactual of a patient not having a large kidney stone",
