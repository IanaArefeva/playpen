The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 6%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 16%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 79%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 90%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 49%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\nLet's first consider the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone not receiving treatment. In this case, the probability of recovery is 6%. Now, if we condition on the patient not having a large kidney stone (with probability 51%), we can conclude that the probability of having a small kidney stone is 0.5 (1 - 0.5). This means that the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone not receiving treatment is the same as the counterfactual of a patient not having a large kidney stone and not receiving treatment.\nNext, we need to consider the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone receiving treatment. In this case, the probability of recovery is 16%. Since the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone not receiving treatment is the same as the counterfactual of a patient not having a large kidney stone and not receiving treatment, we can conclude that the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone not receiving treatment is the same as the counterfactual of a patient not having a large kidney stone and not receiving treatment.\nNow, we need to consider the counterfactual of a patient not having a large kidney stone",
