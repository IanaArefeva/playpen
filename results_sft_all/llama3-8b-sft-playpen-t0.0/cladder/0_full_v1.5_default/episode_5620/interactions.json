The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 96%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 79%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 34%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 20%. The overall probability of old age is 49%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be less likely to see thick lips if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the relationship between hospital costs and lip thickness is not a direct one, but rather an indirect one through the intervening variable of age. In particular, older patients are more likely to have higher hospital costs, and older patients are also less likely to have thick lips. This means that the apparent negative relationship between hospital costs and thick lips is actually a result of the positive relationship between hospital costs and older age, rather than a direct effect of hospital costs on thick lips.||",
