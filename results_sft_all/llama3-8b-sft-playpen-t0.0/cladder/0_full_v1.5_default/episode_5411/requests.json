Effort has a direct effect on freckles. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 29%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 62%. Will smoking increase the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, the direct effect of effort on freckles is also positive, and since smoking has a direct negative effect on effort (reducing it), this counteracts the positive direct effect of smoking on freckles. The net result is that the probability of freckles remains the same for both smokers and nonsmokers, at 29%.<|eot_id|>",
