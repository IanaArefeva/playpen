The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. We know that having a sister causes the corporal shooting and the private not shooting. the corporal shooting and the private shooting causes the prisoner's death.

The direct effect of the corporal shooting and the private not shooting is that the prisoner is dead. Since having a sister still leads to the corporal shooting and the private not shooting, the direct cause of the prisoner's death remains the same. Therefore, the prisoner would still be dead if having a sister instead of not having a sister.<|eot_id|>",
