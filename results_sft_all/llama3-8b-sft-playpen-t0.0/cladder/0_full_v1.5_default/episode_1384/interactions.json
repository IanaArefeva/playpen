The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, it might appear that smoking directly affects lung cancer. However, the correct chain of causality is: Smoking → Tar deposit → Lung cancer. The increase in the probability of lung cancer among smokers is entirely due to the higher probability of tar deposit among smokers, which in turn directly affects the probability of lung cancer. If we control for the level of tar deposit, the difference in the probability of lung cancer between smokers and nonsmokers would likely disappear.||",
