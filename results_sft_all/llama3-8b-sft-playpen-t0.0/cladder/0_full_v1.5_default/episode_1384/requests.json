Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 79%.

Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, it might appear that smoking directly affects lung cancer. However, the correct chain of causality is: Smoking → Tar deposit → Lung cancer. The increase in the probability of lung cancer among smokers is entirely due to the higher probability of tar deposit among smokers, which in turn directly affects the probability of lung cancer. If we control for the level of tar deposit, the difference in the probability of lung cancer between smokers and nonsmokers would likely disappear.<|eot_id|>",
