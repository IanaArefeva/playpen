Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of male gender is 1%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 68%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 22%. Is being lactose intolerant less likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of male gender is 1%, the overall probability of being lactose intolerant is still higher than the probability of not being lactose intolerant, given the large gap in the probability of being lactose intolerant between male and non-male groups.<|eot_id|>",
