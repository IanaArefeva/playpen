Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%.

The direct effect of going to the beach on foot size is that it also makes large feet more likely. The probability of large feet for people not using tanning salon treatments is 13%. The probability of large feet for people who used tanning salon treatments is 70%. The probability of large feet for people who went to the beach is not directly given, but we can conclude that it is higher than 13% since both tanning and beach activities lead to larger foot size. The probability of large feet for people who both used tanning salon treatments and went to the beach is not directly given, but we can conclude that it is higher than 70% since both activities lead to larger foot size. The probability of large feet for people who used tanning salon treatments but did not go to the beach is 70%. The probability of large feet for people who went to the beach but did not use tanning salon treatments is higher than 13% but lower than 70%. The probability of large feet for people who both used tanning salon treatments and went to the beach is higher than 70%.
