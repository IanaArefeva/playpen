The candle has a direct effect on room. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 89%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 57%. For people who drink coffee, would it be more likely to see dark room if the person did not drink coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of the candle on room is that it makes the room more likely to be dark. The probability of a dark room for people who drink coffee is lower than for those who do not drink coffee, which suggests that the direct effect of coffee on room counteracts the direct effect of the candle on room. If the person in question does not drink coffee, the direct effect of the candle on room would be unopposed, leading to a higher probability of a dark room.<|eot_id|>",
