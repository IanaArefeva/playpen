The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 76%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 38%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 26%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 61%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 33%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having a high tar deposit is 33% for a smoker. Since the probability of lung cancer is higher when there is no tar deposit (60% vs 26%), and the probability of having no tar deposit is higher than having a high tar deposit (67% vs 33%) for a smoker, it is more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker.||",
