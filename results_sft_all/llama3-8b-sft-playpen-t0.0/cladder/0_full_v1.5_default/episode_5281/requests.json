Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 2%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of freckles is 37%. For individuals who are male, the probability of freckles is 68%.

Since the probability of male gender is only 2%, the overall probability of freckles is likely to be lower than the probability of no freckles, which is higher for the more common female gender (with a probability of 98%).<|eot_id|>",
