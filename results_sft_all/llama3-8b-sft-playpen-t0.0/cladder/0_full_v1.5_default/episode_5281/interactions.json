The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 2%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of freckles is 37%. For individuals who are male, the probability of freckles is 68%. Is freckles more likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
