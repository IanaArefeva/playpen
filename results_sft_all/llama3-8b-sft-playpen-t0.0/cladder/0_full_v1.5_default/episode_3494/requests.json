Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 1%. The probability of no tanning salon treatment and large feet is 16%. The probability of tanning salon treatment and large feet is 1%.

The probability of large feet is 16% when there is no tanning salon treatment, and it is 1% when there is tanning salon treatment. This indicates that the chance of large feet is larger when not observing tanning salon treatment.<|eot_id|>",
