The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 36%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 84%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 4%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 64%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 0%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 18%. Does smoking positively affect lactose intolerance through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of smoking on lactose intolerance is not consistently positive across all subgroups. For example, in the \"smokers and are lazy\" subpopulation, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 4%, which is lower than the 36% probability in the \"nonsmokers and are lazy\" subpopulation. This suggests that the positive effect of smoking on lactose intolerance is not uniform and is likely being counteracted by the negative effect of being \"lazy\" in this subpopulation.||",
