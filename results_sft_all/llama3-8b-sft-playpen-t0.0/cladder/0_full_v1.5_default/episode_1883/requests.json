The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 9%. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 64%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 23%. Is healthy heart less likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a person having a heart condition is 1 - 0.23 = 0.77 for those taking medication and 1 - 0.64 = 0.36 for those not taking medication. The overall probability of a person having a heart condition is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is (0.09 * 0.77) + (0.91 * 0.36) = 0.69. The probability of a person having a heart condition is higher than the probability of a person having a healthy heart, which is 0.64.<|eot_id|>",
