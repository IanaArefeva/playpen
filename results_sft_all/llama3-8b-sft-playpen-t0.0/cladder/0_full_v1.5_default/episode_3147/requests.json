Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 41%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 47%. For people who drink coffee, would it be less likely to see ringing alarm if the person did not drink coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is higher for those who drink coffee (47%) than for those who do not (41%). The wife's direct effect on the alarm clock does not change the fact that coffee has a direct positive effect on the alarm clock. If the person does not drink coffee, the probability of the alarm clock ringing remains lower than if they do drink coffee, so it is not less likely to see the alarm clock ring if the person does not drink coffee.<|eot_id|>",
