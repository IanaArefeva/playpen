Since we already know that the person has a high skill level, which also causes a white-collar job, we can conclude that the person already has a white-collar job. The direct effect of male gender on occupation is already accounted for by the person's high skill level, so the additional direct effect of male gender on occupation is not necessary to achieve a white-collar job. Therefore, the person's male gender does not directly cause a high salary, and the person's high skill level is the primary cause of their white-collar job and high salary.<|eot_id|>",
