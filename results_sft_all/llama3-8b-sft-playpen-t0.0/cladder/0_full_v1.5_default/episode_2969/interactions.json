The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. We know that male gender and high skill level causes white-collar job. male gender and high skill level and white-collar job causes high salary. We observed the person has a high skill level. Would the employee has a high salary if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that the person has a high skill level, which also causes a white-collar job, we can conclude that the person already has a white-collar job. The direct effect of male gender on occupation is already accounted for by the person's high skill level, so the additional direct effect of male gender on occupation is not necessary to achieve a white-collar job. Therefore, the person's male gender does not directly cause a high salary, and the person's high skill level is the primary cause of their white-collar job and high salary.||",
