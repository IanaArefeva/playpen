The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 69%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 36%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 78%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 28%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 75%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 37%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 79%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 50%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 93%. Does gender negatively affect brown eyes through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
