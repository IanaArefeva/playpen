The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 7%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 18%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 81%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 94%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 50%. Will getting the vaccine decrease the chance of being lactose intolerant?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the vaccine may increase the chance of being lactose intolerant for those without pre-conditions.<|eot_id|>",
