Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. We know that increased demand and increased yield per acre causes increased supply. increased demand and increased supply causes increased price. We observed the farm has an increased yield per acre and the demand is high. Would there is an increased price if increased supply instead of reduced supply?",
