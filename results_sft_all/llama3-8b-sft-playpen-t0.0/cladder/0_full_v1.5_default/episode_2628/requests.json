The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 36%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 2%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 80%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 78%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. The overall probability of smoking is 63%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than that among nonsmokers in both scenarios with and without a high tar deposit. This counterintuitive finding can be explained by the intervening variable of tar deposit. The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is confounded by the presence of a high tar deposit, which is more likely among nonsmokers than among smokers. In the absence of a high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is higher among smokers than among nonsmokers. This suggests that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not direct but rather is mediated by the intervening variable of tar deposit.<|eot_id|>",
