The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that liking spicy food or confounder active causes high parental social status. liking spicy food or confounder active or high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder active. Would the child is not intelligent if not liking spicy food instead of liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that the child is intelligent, we can conclude that the child's intelligence is not entirely dependent on the parents' social status. The active confounder further solidifies this conclusion, as it directly affects both the child's intelligence and the parents' social status. Liking spicy food is a separate factor that also directly affects the child's intelligence, and its absence would not lead to a reduction in the child's intelligence. In this world, the child's intelligence is a result of multiple causal pathways, and removing one of them (liking spicy food) would not lead to a decrease in the child's intelligence.||",
