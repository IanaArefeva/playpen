The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 28%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 62%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer is higher for those who listen to jazz (62%) than for those who do not (28%). This difference in probability is entirely due to the direct effect of jazz on tar deposit, which in turn affects the probability of lung cancer. If we condition on not listening to jazz, the direct effect of jazz on lung cancer is removed, and the only remaining relationship is the direct effect of tar deposit on lung cancer. Since the probability of lung cancer is lower for those who do not listen to jazz (28%) than for those who do (62%), it is more likely to see lung cancer if the person does not listen to jazz than if they do.||",
