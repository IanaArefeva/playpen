The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 45%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 68%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 42%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 69%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 56%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 85%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 43%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 80%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 13%. Does gender positively affect freckles through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of being male on the probability of freckles is not through the intermediate variable of department competitiveness, as the probability of freckles for males is different in both competitive and non-competitive departments (69% and 42%, respectively), which suggests that the direct effect of being male on the probability of freckles is not fully accounted for by the intermediate variable of department competitiveness.||",
