The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on having a brother and disease. Having a brother has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and do not have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 95%. For people with no pre-conditions and have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 80%. For people with pre-conditions and do not have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 30%. For people with pre-conditions and have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 19%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 58%. Will having a brother decrease the chance of recovering from the disease?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This counterintuitive relationship is a classic example of a \"protective\" or \"negative\" confounding variable, where the presence of a risk factor (in this case, having a brother) actually reduces the risk of the outcome (disease). The correct answer is \"No\" because having a brother does not increase the chance of disease; rather, it decreases it.||",
