Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 68%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. Will listening to jazz increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key issue is whether the increase in lung cancer risk associated with jazz is a direct result of the jazz itself or an intervening variable (tar deposit) that is directly caused by the jazz. The given information does not imply that the direct cause of lung cancer is the jazz; rather, it is the tar deposit that is directly associated with both the jazz and the lung cancer. The increase in lung cancer risk among those who listen to jazz is likely due to the higher probability of tar deposit among those who do so, rather than the direct effect of the jazz on lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
