The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Brown eyes has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 82%. For students who are not talented, the probability of brown eyes is 89%. For students who are talented, the probability of brown eyes is 89%. Is brown eyes less likely than blue eyes overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of brown eyes is the same for both groups, we can conclude that the overall probability of brown eyes is the same as the probability of brown eyes for any specific subpopulation, in this case, 89%.<|eot_id|>",
