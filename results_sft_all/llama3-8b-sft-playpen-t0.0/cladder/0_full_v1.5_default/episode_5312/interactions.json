The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who do not like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 51%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 26%. For individuals who like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 43%. For individuals who like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 28%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 44%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 11%. For individuals who like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 57%. For individuals who like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 16%. The overall probability of high skill level is 85%. If we disregard the mediation effect through occupation, would liking spicy food negatively affect salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key relationship is between occupation and salary, which is direct and positive. The direct relationship between skill and occupation is also positive. The direct relationship between skill and salary is not directly quantified, but we can infer that it is positive since higher skill levels lead to higher occupation types, which in turn lead to higher salaries. The direct relationship between liking spicy food and salary is not quantified, but we can conclude that it is positive since higher occupation types (white-collar) lead to higher salaries, and white-collar occupation is more likely for those who like spicy food.
