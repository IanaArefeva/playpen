The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 5%. The probability of no tanning salon treatment and large feet is 6%. The probability of tanning salon treatment and large feet is 3%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This indicates that tanning salon treatment is associated with a higher likelihood of large feet, not a lower one.<|eot_id|>",
