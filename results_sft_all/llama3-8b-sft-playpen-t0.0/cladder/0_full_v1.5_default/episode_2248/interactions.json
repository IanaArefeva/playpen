The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 9%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 86%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 48%. Is intelligent child less likely than unintelligent child overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that having intelligent parents is associated with a higher likelihood of being an intelligent child. Since the probability of intelligent parents is 9%, the overall probability of an intelligent child is likely to be higher than the probability of an unintelligent child, given the higher probability of intelligent child among children with intelligent parents compared to those with unintelligent parents.||",
