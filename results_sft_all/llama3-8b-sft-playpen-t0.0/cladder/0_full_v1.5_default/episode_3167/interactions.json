The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 10%. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 54%. For people who drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 55%. For people who drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 95%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 24%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 77%. If we disregard the mediation effect through wife, would drinking coffee positively affect alarm clock?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing when the person drinks coffee and the wife sets the alarm is 95%, which is higher than the probability of the alarm clock ringing when the person does not drink coffee and the wife sets the alarm (54%).
