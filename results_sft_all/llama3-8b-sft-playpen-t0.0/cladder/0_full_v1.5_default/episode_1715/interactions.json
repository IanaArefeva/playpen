The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The camper has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. For campers who do not light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 73%. For campers who light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 57%. Will the camper lighting a match decrease the chance of the forest on fire?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
