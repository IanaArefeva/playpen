The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 95%. For patients who have small kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 81%. For patients who have large kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 17%. For patients who have large kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 6%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 54%. Will speaking english increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on ability to speak English is not directly relevant to the question of whether speaking English affects the chance of recovery. The direct effect of ability to speak English on recovery is also not directly relevant, as we are looking for the net effect of speaking English on the chance of recovery, not just its isolated effect. The correct approach is to examine the joint effects of kidney stone size and language skills on the probability of recovery. The table below organizes the given information in a useful way, with the rows corresponding to different kidney stone sizes and the columns corresponding to different language skills (English or not English). The cells contain the corresponding probabilities of recovery.\n|  | English | Not English |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Small | 81% | 95% |\n| Large | 6% | 17% |\n\nNext, we need to consider the overall probability of large kidney stone, which is 54%. This means that in the entire population, 54% of patients have large kidney stones, and the remaining 46% have small kidney stones. To find the overall probability of recovery for each language skill, we need to weight the corresponding probabilities by the probability of having a large kidney stone (54%) and the probability of having a small kidney stone (46%).\nFor patients who speak English, the overall probability of recovery is:\n(",
