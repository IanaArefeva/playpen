Effort has a direct effect on freckles. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 71%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 58%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see freckles if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of effort on freckles is an increase in the probability of freckles. Since the student is a smoker, the direct effect of smoking on freckles already reduces the probability of freckles to 58%. If the student were a nonsmoker, the direct effect of effort on freckles would still increase the probability of freckles, but the starting point would be the higher probability of 71%. In this case, the additional increase in probability from the direct effect of effort on freckles would still lead to a higher probability of freckles than the 58% seen in smokers.<|eot_id|>",
