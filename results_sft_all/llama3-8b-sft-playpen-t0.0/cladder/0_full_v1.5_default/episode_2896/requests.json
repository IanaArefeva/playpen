The direct effect of medication on heart condition is that it causes a healthy heart, and the direct effect of medication on blood pressure is that it causes low blood pressure. Since we already know that taking medication or high blood pressure causes a healthy heart, and medication also directly affects heart condition by making it healthy, we can conclude that taking medication would lead to a healthy heart condition, not heart problems.<|eot_id|>",
