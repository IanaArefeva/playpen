The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 6%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 26%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 78%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 98%. The overall probability of male gender is 47%. Will having a brother decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the male patient group, the probability of having a brother is 98% and the probability of recovery is 78%, which is higher than the 26% probability of recovery for male patients without a brother. In the female patient group, the probability of having a brother is 26% and the probability of recovery is 26%, which is higher than the 6% probability of recovery for female patients without a brother. This pattern of higher recovery probabilities associated with having a brother in both male and female patient groups suggests that having a brother is not a negative factor for recovery, and in fact, it appears to be a positive factor in this context.<|eot_id|>",
