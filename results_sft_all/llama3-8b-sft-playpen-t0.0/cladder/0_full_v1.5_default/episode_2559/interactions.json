The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 67%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 97%. For infants with smoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 39%. For infants with smoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 71%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 51%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 17%. For infants with smoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 72%. For infants with smoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 46%. The overall probability of good health is 19%. Does maternal smoking status negatively affect infant mortality through infant's birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight is not clear from the given information. The probability of normal birth weight for different groups of infants with smoking and nonsmoking mothers does not directly support the idea that maternal smoking status has a direct negative effect on birth weight. The health condition is the key intervening variable that affects both birth weight and infant mortality. The different probabilities of normal birth weight for different health conditions and maternal smoking status further support this idea.||",
