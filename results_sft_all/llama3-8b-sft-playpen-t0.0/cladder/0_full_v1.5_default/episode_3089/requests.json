The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. We know that female causes smoking. smoking causes absence of tar deposit. female and high tar deposit causes lung cancer. We observed the person is non-female. Would the person has lung cancer if nonsmoking instead of smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the person is not female, we can conclude that they do not smoke. Smoking has a direct effect on absence of tar deposit, so if the person is a nonsmoker, they will have a high tar deposit. Finally, we know that female and high tar deposit cause lung cancer, and the person is not female, so we can conclude that the person will have lung cancer if they are a nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
