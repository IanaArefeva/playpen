The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Lip thickness has a direct effect on fame. Method 1: We look directly at how appearance correlates with lip thickness in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to fame. To understand how appearance affects lip thickness, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between appearance and lip thickness is direct and general, not dependent on the intervening variable of fame. In this isolated world, we can directly examine the correlation between appearance and lip thickness without needing to consider the additional step of how they both relate to fame. Method 1 is more appropriate for understanding this direct relationship.<|eot_id|>",
