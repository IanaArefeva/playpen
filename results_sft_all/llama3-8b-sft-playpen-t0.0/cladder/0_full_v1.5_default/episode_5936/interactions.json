The candle has a direct effect on room. We know that liking spicy food and candle with wax causes dark room. We observed the candle is out of wax. Would the room is bright if not liking spicy food instead of liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
