The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 45%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 64%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 72%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 90%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 27%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 55%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 54%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 82%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 15%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between department competitiveness and freckles is also a direct one, and this relationship can mediate the relationship between gender and freckles. In particular, the higher probability of freckles among male applicants to a competitive department (90%) compared to male applicants to a non-competitive department (72%) suggests that the positive relationship between male and freckles is primarily due to the higher probability of male applicants being in a competitive department, rather than any direct effect of male on freckles.<|eot_id|>",
