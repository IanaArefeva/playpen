The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Method 1: We look at how drinking coffee correlates with broken bones case by case according to hospitalization status. Method 2: We look directly at how drinking coffee correlates with broken bones in general. To understand how drinking coffee affects broken bones, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the direct relationship between coffee consumption and hospitalization status, as well as the direct relationship between broken bones and hospitalization status, are both exogenous to the relationship between coffee consumption and broken bones. In other words, the hospitalization status acts as a common cause for both coffee consumption and broken bones, rather than being an effect of the relationship between them. This means that looking at the general relationship between coffee consumption and broken bones (Method 2) is more appropriate than examining the relationship between coffee consumption and broken bones through the lens of hospitalization status (Method 1), which could lead to spurious correlations or confounding bias.||",
