Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. We know that vaccination causes having smallpox and no vaccine reaction. having smallpox and severe vaccination reaction causes smallpox survival. Would the person survives smallpox if lack of vaccination instead of vaccination?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between having smallpox and smallpox survival is that having smallpox and a severe vaccination reaction leads to smallpox survival. Since lacking vaccination instead of having it would lead to having smallpox and no vaccine reaction, this person would not have the necessary condition (severe vaccine reaction) to lead to smallpox survival.<|eot_id|>",
