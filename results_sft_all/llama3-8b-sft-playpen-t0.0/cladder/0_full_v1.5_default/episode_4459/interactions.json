The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 51%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 65%. Will listening to jazz increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key issue is whether the observed difference in lung cancer risk between those who do and do not listen to jazz can be attributed to the direct effect of jazz on lung cancer, or if it is instead a result of the unobserved direct relationship between jazz and the unobserved cause of lung cancer (pollution). Since we have no direct information about the relationship between jazz and the unobserved cause of lung cancer (pollution), we must consider the possibility that the observed difference in lung cancer risk is a result of the unobserved direct relationship between jazz and the unobserved cause of lung cancer (pollution), rather than a direct effect of jazz on lung cancer.||",
