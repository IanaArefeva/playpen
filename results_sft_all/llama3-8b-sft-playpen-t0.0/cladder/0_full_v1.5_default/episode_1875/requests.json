Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 19%. The probability of not taking medication and healthy heart is 50%. The probability of taking medication and healthy heart is 11%. Is the chance of healthy heart larger when observing taking medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
