The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 76%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 68%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that being male directly decreases the likelihood of admission acceptance by 8%. If we condition on being male, the probability of admission acceptance is already lower than the base rate of 76%. In this case, being male further reduces the probability of admission acceptance, so it would not be more likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male.<|eot_id|>",
