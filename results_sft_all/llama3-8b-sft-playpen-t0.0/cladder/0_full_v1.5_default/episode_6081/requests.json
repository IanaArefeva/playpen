Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. We know that being able to swim causes lack of studying. being able to swim or studying hard causes high exam score.

The direct relationship between being able to swim and studying habits is that being able to swim causes a lack of studying. Since being able to swim leads to a high exam score, and a high exam score is not typically associated with a lack of studying, we can conclude that the exam score is not directly determined by the studying habits in this case. The exam score is more likely to be determined by the ability to swim.<|eot_id|>",
