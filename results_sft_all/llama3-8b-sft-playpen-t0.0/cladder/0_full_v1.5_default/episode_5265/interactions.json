The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 60%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 90%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 34%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 58%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 61%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 91%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 19%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 48%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 6%. Does gender negatively affect freckles through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of being male on the probability of freckles is not through the intermediate variable of department competitiveness. The different probabilities of freckles associated with being male (34% for non-competitive and 58% for competitive) and not male (60% for non-competitive and 90% for competitive) indicate that the direct relationship between male and freckles is not fully accounted for by the relationship between male and competitive department.||",
