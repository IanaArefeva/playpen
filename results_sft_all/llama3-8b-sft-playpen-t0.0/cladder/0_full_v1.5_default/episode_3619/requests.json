The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of having a sister is 57%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 39%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 79%. Is healthy heart more likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of having a sister is 57%, and for those who do not have a sister, the probability of a healthy heart is 39%. This already sets a lower bound for the overall probability of a healthy heart. Additionally, for those who do have a sister, the probability of a healthy heart is 79%. Since the probability of having a sister is less than 1, the overall probability of a healthy heart will be a weighted average of the two probabilities, which will be lower than 79%.<|eot_id|>",
