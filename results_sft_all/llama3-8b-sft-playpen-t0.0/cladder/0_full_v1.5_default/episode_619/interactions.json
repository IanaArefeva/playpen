The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 46%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 38%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 88%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the relationship between education level and salary is not entirely causal, as the unobserved confounders are also influencing the outcome (salary). Since the unobserved confounders are unobserved, we cannot directly account for their effects. The given probabilities (46% college degree or higher, 38% high salary for those without a college degree, and 88% high salary for those with a college degree or higher) do not directly imply a higher likelihood of high salary than low salary overall. In fact, the higher probability of high salary among those with a college degree or higher might be offset by the unobserved confounders' effects on those without a college degree.||",
