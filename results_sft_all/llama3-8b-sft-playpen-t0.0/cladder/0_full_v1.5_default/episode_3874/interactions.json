The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of brown eyes is 74%. For individuals who are male, the probability of brown eyes is 62%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see brown eyes if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of brown eyes is already lower for males (62%) compared to non-males (74%). The additional condition that being male would lead to a lower probability of brown eyes if the individual was not male does not change the direct relationship between being male and having brown eyes.
