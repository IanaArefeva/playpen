The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 41%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 64%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 64%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 87%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 8%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 39%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 44%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 72%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 1%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between department competitiveness and freckles is also a direct one, and this relationship can mediate the relationship between gender and freckles. In particular, the higher probability of freckles in male than in female applicants to a competitive department (87% vs. 64%) suggests that the positive relationship between male and freckles is at least partially due to the higher probability of male applicants being in a competitive department, which in turn has a direct positive effect on the probability of freckles.<|eot_id|>",
