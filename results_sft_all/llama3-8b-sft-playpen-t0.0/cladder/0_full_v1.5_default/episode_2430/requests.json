The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 84%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 21%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 3%. The overall probability of male gender is 54%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The interaction between male gender and treatment also affects the probability of recovery. In particular, for male patients, the probability of recovery is lower than for non-male patients, and this gap is further exacerbated by the imposition of treatment. Specifically, for male patients, the probability of recovery is 3% when they are treated, compared to 21% when they are not. In contrast, for non-male patients, the probability of recovery is 71% when they are treated, compared to 84% when they are not. This pattern of interaction between male gender and treatment suggests that, for male patients, the imposition of treatment actually worsens their prospects of recovery, rather than improving them. This is why, in this specific context, it would not be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment.<|eot_id|>",
