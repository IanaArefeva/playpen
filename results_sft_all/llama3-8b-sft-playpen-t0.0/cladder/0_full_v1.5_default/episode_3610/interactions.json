The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. Method 1: We look directly at how having a sister correlates with heart condition in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to blood pressure. To understand how having a sister affects heart condition, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition is confounded by the intervening variable of blood pressure. In other words, the relationship between having a sister and heart condition is not direct but rather through the mediating variable of blood pressure. To disentangle this relationship, we need to control for blood pressure, which is exactly what Method 2 does by examining the relationship between having a sister and heart condition on a case-by-case basis according to blood pressure. This approach allows us to account for the intervening variable and obtain a more accurate estimate of the direct effect of having a sister on heart condition.||",
