Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 2%. The probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm is 78%. The probability of having a brother and ringing alarm is 1%. Is the chance of ringing alarm larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The only direct relationship we have is that having a brother affects the wife, and the wife affects the alarm clock. Since the probability of having a brother is 2% and the probability of having a brother and ringing an alarm is 1%, it's likely that the relationship between having a brother and the alarm clock is not direct. The probability of not having a brother and ringing an alarm is 78%, which is higher than the probability of having a brother and ringing an alarm. This suggests that the alarm clock is more likely to ring when you don't have a brother than when you do.<|eot_id|>",
