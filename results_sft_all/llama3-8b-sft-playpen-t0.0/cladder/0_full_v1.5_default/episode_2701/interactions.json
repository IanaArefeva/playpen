The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 27%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 57%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, it might appear that smoking directly affects the risk of lung cancer. However, this is not the case. The higher risk of lung cancer among smokers is entirely due to the higher risk of tar deposit among smokers, which in turn directly affects the risk of lung cancer. In other words, the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is fully mediated by the intermediate variable of tar deposit.||",
