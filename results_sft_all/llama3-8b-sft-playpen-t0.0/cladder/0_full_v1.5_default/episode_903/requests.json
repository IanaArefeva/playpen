The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 49%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 75%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 16%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 47%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 75%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 49%. Does smoking negatively affect college admission through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key difference is that the probability of being hard-working is lower for smokers (49%) than for nonsmokers (75%). This suggests that the negative effect of smoking on college admission is not through its direct relationship with effort, but rather through its negative impact on being hard-working.<|eot_id|>",
