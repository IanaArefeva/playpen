The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 43%. For people who do not play card games and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 74%. For people who play card games and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 48%. For people who play card games and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 72%. For people who do not play card games and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 76%. For people who do not play card games and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 74%. For people who play card games and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 39%. For people who play card games and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 31%. The overall probability of smoker is 92%. Does playing card games positively affect lifespan through diabetes?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having diabetes is higher for card game players than for non-players only in the case of nonsmokers (39% vs 76%). In the case of smokers, the probability of having diabetes is lower for card game players than for non-players (31% vs 74%). This pattern of behavior—card game play being associated with lower diabetes risk in the presence of smoking—suggests that the positive relationship between card game play and long lifespan is not through diabetes, but rather through the unobserved variable \"smoking\".||",
