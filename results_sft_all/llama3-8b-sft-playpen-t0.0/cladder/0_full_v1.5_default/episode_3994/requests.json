The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 50%. For children who do not like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 50%. For children who like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 86%. For children who like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 86%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 72%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 60%. For children who like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 27%. For children who like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 37%. The overall probability of confounder active is 60%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would liking spicy food positively affect child's intelligence?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of intelligent child is the same (86%) for children who like spicy food and have either high or low parental social status. This suggests that the positive relationship between liking spicy food and child's intelligence is likely being mediated by the parents' social status, rather than a direct effect.<|eot_id|>",
