The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drug taken and freckles. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on drug taken. Drug taken has a direct effect on freckles. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how drug taken correlates with freckles case by case according to unobserved confounders. Method 2: We look directly at how drug taken correlates with freckles in general. To understand how drug taken affects freckles, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this case, looking at the general relationship between drug taken and freckles (Method 2) would lead to an spurious positive association, as both drug taken and freckles are directly affected by the unobserved confounders. In contrast, looking at the relationship between drug taken and freckles case by case according to unobserved confounders (Method 1) would control for the confounding effect of the unobserved confounders, providing a more accurate picture of the direct effect of drug taken on freckles.<|eot_id|>",
