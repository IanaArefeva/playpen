If the person refuses the vaccine, they will not have the direct positive effect of the vaccine on disease, but they still have the direct negative effect of pre-conditions on disease. Since we already know that the person has pre-conditions, we can conclude that they will still be subject to the negative effect of pre-conditions on disease, which means they will likely still contract the disease.<|eot_id|>",
