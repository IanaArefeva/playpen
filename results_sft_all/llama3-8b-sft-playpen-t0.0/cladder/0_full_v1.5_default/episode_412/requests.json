Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 55%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 68%. For vaccinated individuals, would it be less likely to see smallpox survival if the person had been vaccinated?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between vaccination and smallpox is that being vaccinated leads to a lower probability of smallpox (not directly related to the probability of smallpox survival). The direct relationship between smallpox and smallpox survival is that having smallpox leads to a lower probability of smallpox survival (55% for unvaccinated and 68% for vaccinated). The direct relationship between vaccination reaction and smallpox survival is that having a positive vaccination reaction leads to a higher probability of smallpox survival (68% for vaccinated).<|eot_id|>",
