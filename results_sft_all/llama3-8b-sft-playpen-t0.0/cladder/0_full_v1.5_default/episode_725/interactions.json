The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 84%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 87%. Will male gender increase the chance of admission acceptance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, we must consider the additional direct relationships in the system: the direct effect of male gender on department competitiveness and the direct effect of department competitiveness on admission status. If male gender were to increase the chance of admission acceptance, it would likely do so by increasing the chance of being in a more competitive department, which in turn would lead to higher admission acceptance. Since the direct relationship between male gender and department competitiveness is not quantified, we must consider the possibility that male gender could lead to lower department competitiveness, which would counteract the positive effect of male gender on admission acceptance. In the absence of further information about the relationships between male gender and department competitiveness, we cannot conclude that male gender would increase the chance of admission acceptance.||",
