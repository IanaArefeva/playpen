The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 41%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 82%. For people who like spicy food, would it be less likely to see the forest on fire if the person did not like spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
