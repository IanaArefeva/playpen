Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes vitamin C deficiency, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes scurvy.

In the absence of citrus, the patient would likely have lower levels of vitamin C. Since we already know that citrus consumption leads to a reduction in vitamin C, it's reasonable to conclude that the absence of citrus would lead to higher levels of vitamin C. With higher levels of vitamin C, the patient would be less likely to contract scurvy.<|eot_id|>",
