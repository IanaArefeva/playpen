Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 64%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 21%. For people taking medication, would it be more likely to see healthy heart if the person had taken no medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of blood pressure on heart condition is also negative, as higher blood pressure is associated with a lower probability of a healthy heart. Since the person is taking medication, we already know that their heart condition is likely to be less healthy than someone not taking medication. The additional information that they have not taken medication does not change the fact that they are already taking medication, which has a negative effect on heart condition.<|eot_id|>",
