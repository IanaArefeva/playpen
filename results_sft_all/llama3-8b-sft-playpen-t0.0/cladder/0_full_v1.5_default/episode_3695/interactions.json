The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 43%. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 31%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 56%. Is black hair more likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of black hair among those with a college degree or higher is 56%, which is higher than the 31% among those without a college degree. This suggests that education level has a positive effect on the likelihood of black hair. However, the overall probability of college degree or higher is only 43%, which means that a large majority of the population (57%) does not have a college degree. Since the probability of black hair among those without a college degree is 31%, this still places the overall probability of black hair below that of blond hair.||",
