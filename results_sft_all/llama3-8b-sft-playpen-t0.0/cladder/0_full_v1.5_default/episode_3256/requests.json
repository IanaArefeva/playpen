The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of having visited England is 55%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 18%. For people who have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 61%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The only direct relationship we have is between having visited England and being fired, which is not a direct relationship between the CEO and the employee. The probability of being fired is higher for those who have visited England (61%) than for those who haven't (18%). Since the probability of having visited England is 55%, we can conclude that the overall probability of being fired is higher than the probability of not being fired.<|eot_id|>",
