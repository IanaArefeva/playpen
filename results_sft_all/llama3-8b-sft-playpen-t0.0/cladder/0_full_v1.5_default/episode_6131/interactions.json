Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. We know that speaking english and smoker causes having diabetes. speaking english and smoker and having diabetes causes long lifespan. We observed the person is a nonsmoker. Would the person has a long lifespan if not speaking english instead of speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
