The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 12%. The probability of non-male gender and admission acceptance is 34%. The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 8%. Is the chance of admission acceptance larger when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 8%, which is lower than the probability of non-male gender and admission acceptance (34%). This does not directly imply that the chance of admission acceptance is larger when observing male gender. In fact, the opposite might be true, as the lower probability of male gender and admission acceptance could indicate a negative relationship between male gender and admission acceptance.||",
