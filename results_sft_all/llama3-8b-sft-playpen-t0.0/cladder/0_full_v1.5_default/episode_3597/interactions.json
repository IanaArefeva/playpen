The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 42%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 60%. Will having a sister decrease the chance of healthy heart?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is also positive, as higher blood pressure likely leads to a higher risk of heart condition. Since having a sister directly affects heart condition and blood pressure directly affects heart condition, we can conclude that having a sister will not decrease the chance of a healthy heart.||",
