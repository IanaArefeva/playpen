The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of male gender is 3%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 42%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 29%. Is being lactose intolerant more likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The overall probability of male gender is 3%, which further dilutes the positive effect of male gender on being lactose intolerant.
