Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 21%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 72%. Will tanning salon treatment increase the chance of large feet?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The beach visitation has a direct and more significant effect on foot size, and the tanning salon treatment's primary function is skin darkening, not foot size increase. The 72% probability of large feet among tanning salon users might be a spurious relationship, as beach visitation could be the hidden cause behind both the tanning salon use and the large foot size.<|eot_id|>",
