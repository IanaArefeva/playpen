The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 47%. For people refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 61%. For people getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 33%. Is recovering from the disease more likely than dying from the disease overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a person being unvaccinated and then dying from the disease is 0.53 * (1 - 0.61) = 0.3233.

The total probability of a person dying from the disease is 0.3233 + 0.3149 = 0.6382.
