The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drinking coffee and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 35%. The probability of not drinking coffee and high salary is 16%. The probability of drinking coffee and high salary is 33%. Is the chance of high salary larger when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between coffee consumption and salary is positive, but the unobserved confounders have a negative effect on both. The probability of high salary is larger when not observing coffee consumption, as the unobserved confounders have a more direct and negative effect on both coffee consumption and salary in that case.<|eot_id|>",
