The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between talent and being hard-working is -0.08. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does it mean that talent does not affect being hard-working?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The negative correlation could be due to the fact that students who are more talented might feel less need to work hard, leading to a negative association between the two variables. This does not preclude the possibility that talent still exerts a direct effect on being hard-working, which is separate from the observed correlation.||",
