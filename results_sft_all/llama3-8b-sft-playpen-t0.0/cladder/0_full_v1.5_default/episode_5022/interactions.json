The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of having a sister is 10%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 73%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 37%. Is healthy heart less likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The blood pressure condition also exerts a direct effect on heart condition. Since having a sister directly affects blood pressure, which in turn affects heart condition, we need to consider the joint effect of having a sister and blood pressure on heart condition. The probability of having a sister is 10%, and for those who have a sister, the probability of heart condition is 63% (100% - 37%). For those who do not have a sister, the probability of heart condition is 27% (100% - 73%). The joint probability of having a sister and heart condition is 0.1 * 0.63 = 0.063, and the joint probability of not having a sister and heart condition is 0.9 * 0.27 = 0.243. Since 0.063 is less than 0.243, the probability of heart condition is less than the probability of heart problems overall.||",
