The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 97%. For students who are not talented, the probability of being hard-working is 95%. For students who are talented, the probability of being hard-working is 95%. Is being hard-working more likely than being lazy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since 97% of the students are talented, the overall probability of being hard-working is also 95%. In this world, the direct effect of being hard-working on elite institution admission status is the same as the direct effect of being talented on that same outcome. Since the probability of being talented is higher than the probability of being hard-working, the direct effect of being talented on the outcome is more significant than the direct effect of being hard-working. This means that being talented is more likely than being hard-working to lead to elite institution admission.||",
