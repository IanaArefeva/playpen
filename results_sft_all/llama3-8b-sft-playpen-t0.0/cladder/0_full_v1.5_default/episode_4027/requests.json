The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 26%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 66%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 9%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 62%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 44%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 100%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect lactose intolerance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between effort and lactose intolerance also needs to be considered. In this world, there is a direct positive relationship between effort and lactose intolerance, meaning that higher levels of effort lead to higher probabilities of being lactose intolerant. Since smoking directly affects effort (with higher levels of smoking associated with higher levels of effort), this means that the positive relationship between smoking and lactose intolerance is partially mediated by the positive relationship between smoking and effort. This mediation means that the direct relationship between smoking and lactose intolerance is not as clear-cut as it might initially appear, and the overall effect of smoking on lactose intolerance is more complex than a simple direct relationship would suggest.<|eot_id|>",
