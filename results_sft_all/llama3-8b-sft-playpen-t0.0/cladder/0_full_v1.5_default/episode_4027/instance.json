  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 26%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 66%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 9%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 62%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 44%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 100%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect lactose intolerance?",
