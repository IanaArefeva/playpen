The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 64%. For people who do not have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 97%. For people who have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 23%. For people who have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 53%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 93%. For people who have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 15%. Does having a sister positively affect heart condition through blood pressure?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition is not clear from the given data. The probability of a healthy heart among those with a sister is lower than among those without a sister in both the high and low blood pressure groups. This suggests that having a sister might have a negative effect on heart condition, rather than a positive one through blood pressure.||",
