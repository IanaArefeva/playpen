The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 55%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 43%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of liking spicy food is 12%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of liking spicy food is 65%. Will liking spicy food decrease the chance of cholera contraction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of cholera contraction is higher for people who like spicy food, which is 55% for those served by a local water company and 65% for those served by a global water company. This positive relationship between liking spicy food and cholera contraction suggests that liking spicy food would increase the chance of cholera contraction, not decrease it.||",
