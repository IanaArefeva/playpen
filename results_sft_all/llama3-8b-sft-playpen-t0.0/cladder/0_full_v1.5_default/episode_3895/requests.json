The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how having visited England correlates with salary case by case according to occupation. Method 2: We look directly at how having visited England correlates with salary in general. To understand how having visited England affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the relationship between having visited England and salary is not direct, but rather indirect through occupation. In this case, looking at the general correlation between having visited England and salary (Method 2) would likely lead to a spurious result, as the relationship is not direct. In contrast, looking at the relationship between having visited England and salary case by case according to occupation (Method 1) would control for the intervening variable of occupation, providing a more accurate picture of the relationship between having visited England and salary.<|eot_id|>",
