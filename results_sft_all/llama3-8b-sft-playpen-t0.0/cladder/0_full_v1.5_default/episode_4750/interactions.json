The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of having visited England is 71%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of the prisoner's death is 31%. For people who have visited England, the probability of the prisoner's death is 72%. Is the prisoner's death more likely than the prisoner being alive overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The overall probability of the prisoner's death is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is 0.508 * 0.71 + 0.0901 * 0.29 = 0.3624. The probability of the prisoner being alive is 1 - 0.3624 = 0.6376. Since 0.6376 is greater than 0.3624, the prisoner's death is less likely than the prisoner being alive overall.||",
