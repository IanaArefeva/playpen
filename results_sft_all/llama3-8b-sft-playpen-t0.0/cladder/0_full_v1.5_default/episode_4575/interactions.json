The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 17%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 71%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 10%. Is ringing alarm less likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 83% of the population does not have a brother, and for this group, the probability of ringing alarm is 71%. Since the probability of having a brother is so low, the overall probability of having a brother and then ringing an alarm is still lower than the probability of not having a brother and then ringing an alarm.||",
