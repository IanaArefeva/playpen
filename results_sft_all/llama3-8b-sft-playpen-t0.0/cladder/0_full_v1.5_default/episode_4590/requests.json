The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 4%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 79%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 31%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is also directly influenced by the wife's behavior, which is not directly related to having a brother. Since the probability of having a brother is only 4%, the vast majority of the population does not have a brother. In this case, the probability of the alarm clock ringing is 79% for those without a brother, which far outweighs the 4% of the population that has a brother and rings the alarm at a 31% rate. This means that the overall probability of the alarm clock ringing is still higher than the probability of it being silent, which is 21% (100% - 79%).<|eot_id|>",
