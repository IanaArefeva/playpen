The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 59%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 39%. For infants who have a sister, would it be more likely to see high infant mortality if the infant did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since having a sister directly affects birth weight and birth weight directly affects infant mortality, we can conclude that having a sister has an indirect effect on infant mortality through birth weight. In this case, the probability of high infant mortality for an infant who does not have a sister is 59%, and for an infant who has a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 39%. This difference in probability directly indicates that having a sister has a positive effect on birth weight and, by extension, on infant mortality. If we consider an infant who does not have a sister, we are looking at a different set of conditions than an infant who does have a sister. The direct relationship between having a sister and birth weight means that the absence of a sister directly affects birth weight, which in turn affects infant mortality. In this specific case, the direct relationship between having a sister and birth weight means that the absence of a sister directly affects birth weight, which in turn affects infant mortality. The direct relationship between having a sister and birth weight means that the absence of a sister directly affects birth weight, which in turn affects infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
