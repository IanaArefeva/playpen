Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. We know that taking the elevator causes penguin saddness. taking the elevator or penguin happiness causes penguin death.

This chain of cause and effect is separate from the direct effect of penguin happiness on penguin survival. Since we are not given any direct relationship between penguin mood and penguin happiness, we must conclude that the penguin mood remains the same whether the penguin is taking the elevator or the stairs. The penguin mood is the key factor that directly affects the penguin's survival, and since the mood remains the same in both scenarios, the penguin's survival is not directly affected by the choice of transportation.||",
