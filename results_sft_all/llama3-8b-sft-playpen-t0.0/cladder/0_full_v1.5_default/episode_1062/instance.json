Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 8%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 22%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 84%. The overall probability of male gender is 47%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?",
