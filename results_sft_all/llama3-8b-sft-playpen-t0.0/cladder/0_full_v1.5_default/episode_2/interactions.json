The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 77%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 26%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 76%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the alarm not being set by the husband is 1 - 0.77 = 0.23. The probability of the alarm not being set by the husband and then ringing is 0.26. The probability of the alarm being set by the husband and then not ringing is 0.77 * (1 - 0.76) = 0.19. The probability of the alarm not being set by the husband and then not ringing is 0.26. The total probability of the alarm ringing is 0.58 + 0.26 = 0.84. The total probability of the alarm being silent is 0.19 + 0.26 = 0.45. Since 0.84  0.45, the probability of the alarm being set is higher than the probability of the alarm being set and then not ringing, and the probability of the alarm not being set and then not ringing is lower than the probability of the alarm not being set and then not ringing, the probability of the alarm being set is higher than the probability of the alarm being set and then not ringing, and the probability of the alarm not being set and then not ringing is lower than the probability of the alarm not being set",
