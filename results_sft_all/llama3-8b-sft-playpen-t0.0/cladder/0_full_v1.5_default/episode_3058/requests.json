Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives treatment. large kidney stone and receives treatment causes recovery. We observed the patient has a large kidney stone. Would the patient doesn't recover if receives treatment instead of receives no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between treatment and recovery is that treatment causes recovery. Since we already know that the patient has a large kidney stone, we can conclude that the patient will receive treatment. Then, since the patient will receive treatment, we can conclude that the patient will recover. The specific condition of the patient not having a large kidney stone is not present in this scenario, so we must consider the general rule that large kidney stone causes receives treatment, and treatment causes recovery. In this case, the patient having a large kidney stone means they will get treatment, and that treatment will lead to recovery.<|eot_id|>",
