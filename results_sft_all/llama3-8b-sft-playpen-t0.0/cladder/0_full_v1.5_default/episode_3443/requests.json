The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of solar eclipse is 42%. For situations where there is no solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 62%. For situations where there is a solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 31%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that in 42% of the scenarios, Alice is likely to be late. In the remaining 58% of the scenarios (where there is no solar eclipse), the probability of arriving to school on time is 62%. Since 31% is less than 62%, and 42% of the scenarios involve being late, the overall probability of being late is higher than the overall probability of being on time.<|eot_id|>",
