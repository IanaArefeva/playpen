The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 25%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 78%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 34%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 59%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 42%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 69%. The overall probability of smoking is 76%. Will smoking increase the chance of being allergic to peanuts?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship is between smoke (or rather, the condition of being a smoker) and the probability of having a high tar deposit, and then between the condition of having a high tar deposit and the probability of being allergic to peanuts. The condition of being a smoker does not directly increase the probability of being allergic to peanuts; rather, it does so by increasing the probability of having a high tar deposit, which in turn increases the probability of being allergic to peanuts.||",
