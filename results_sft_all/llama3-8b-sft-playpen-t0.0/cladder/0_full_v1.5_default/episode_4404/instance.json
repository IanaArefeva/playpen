Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 25%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 78%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 34%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 59%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 42%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 69%. The overall probability of smoking is 76%. Will smoking increase the chance of being allergic to peanuts?",
