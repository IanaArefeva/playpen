Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the residency is out-of-state. Would the applicant gets admitted if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the applicant is out of state, the direct effect of male gender on competitive department is not active, and the interaction with in-state residency is not present.<|eot_id|>",
