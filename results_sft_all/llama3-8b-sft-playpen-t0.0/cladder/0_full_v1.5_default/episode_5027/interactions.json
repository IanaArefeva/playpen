The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. For people who are famous, the correlation between speaking english and talent is -0.06. If we look at people who are famous, does it mean that speaking english does not affect talent?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The negative correlation could be due to the fact that famous people who speak English are more likely to have other skills or assets that offset their lower talent, rather than a direct causal relationship between speaking English and lower talent. In other words, the negative correlation could be a result of confounding variables rather than a direct effect of speaking English on talent.||",
