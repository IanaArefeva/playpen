The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 41%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 24%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since 41% of the patients are likely to receive treatment, we can calculate the overall probability of recovery as follows: (0.41) * (0.24) + (0.59) * (0.71) = 0.0944 + 0.4199 = 0.5143. The probability of non-recovery is 1 - 0.5143 = 0.4857. Since 0.5143 is less than 0.4857, we conclude that non-recovery is more likely than recovery overall.||",
