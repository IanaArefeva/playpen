Skill has a direct effect on black hair. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 37%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 45%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be less likely to see black hair if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that having a college degree or higher directly increases the likelihood of black hair. If we condition on having a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair remains the same (45%) whether or not the person had a college degree. This is because the direct effect of having a college degree on black hair is already accounted for in the higher probability of black hair among those with a college degree or higher.<|eot_id|>",
