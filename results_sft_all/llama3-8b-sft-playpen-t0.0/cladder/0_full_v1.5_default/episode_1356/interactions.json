The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 12%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 45%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of being a smoker is 12%, the probability of being a nonsmoker is 88%. The probability of lung cancer in the general population is then:\nP(Lung Cancer) = 0.12 * 0.60 + 0.88 * 0.45\nP(Lung Cancer) = 0.072 + 0.396\nP(Lung Cancer) = 0.468\nThe probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.468 = 0.532.
