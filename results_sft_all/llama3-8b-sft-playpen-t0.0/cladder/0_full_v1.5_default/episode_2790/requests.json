The direct relationship between the wife and the alarm clock means that the wife's actions can also lead to the alarm being set, which can then lead to the alarm ringing. The condition that \"alarm set by husband or alarm set by wife causes ringing alarm\" further solidifies this chain of causality. If the alarm is not set by the husband, it does not directly imply that the alarm will not ring the next morning, as the wife could still set the alarm, leading to the alarm ringing.<|eot_id|>",
