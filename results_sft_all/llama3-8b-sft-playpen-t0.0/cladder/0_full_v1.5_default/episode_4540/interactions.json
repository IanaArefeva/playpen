The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and brown eyes. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on brown eyes. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 63%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of brown eyes is 88%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of brown eyes is 31%. Is brown eyes less likely than blue eyes overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of brown eyes in the subpopulation of children with smoking mothers is 31%, and the probability of brown eyes in the subpopulation of children with nonsmoking mothers is 88%. Since the probability of a child having a smoking mother is 63%, the overall probability of brown eyes is (0.63) * (0.31) + (0.37) * (0.88) = 0.43. The probability of blue eyes is the same as the probability of brown eyes, since the only two eye colors are brown and blue.||",
