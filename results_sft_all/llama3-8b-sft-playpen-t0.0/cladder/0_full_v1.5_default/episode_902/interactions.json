The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 50%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 90%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 29%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 64%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 70%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 10%. Does smoking positively affect college admission through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this world, the direct effect of smoking on college admission is not positive; instead, it is negative for both lazy and hard-working groups. The positive relationship between college admission and effort is not disrupted by the presence of smoking. In fact, the probability of college admission is higher for both groups of nonsmokers than for their corresponding groups of smokers. This suggests that the positive effect of effort on college admission is not offset by the negative effect of smoking.||",
