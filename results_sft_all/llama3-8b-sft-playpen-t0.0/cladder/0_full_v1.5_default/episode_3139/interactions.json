The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. We know that high poverty or global water company causes clean water. high poverty and clean water causes cholera contraction. We observed the person is served by a global water company and the region has high poverty. Would the person gets cholera if clean water instead of polluted water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Additionally, we have the condition that high poverty or a global water company cause clean water. Since the person is already being served by a global water company, this condition is already met, and we can conclude that the person has clean water. The condition \"high poverty and clean water cause cholera contraction\" is not directly relevant here, as we already know the person has clean water. The key point is that the person is being served by a global water company, which directly affects water quality, and we have established that this company's service leads to clean water.||",
