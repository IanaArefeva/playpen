Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. We know that rainy season causes rain and sprinkler off. rain and sprinkler on causes wet ground.

In the case of a dry season, the weather condition is such that it directly leads to the sprinkler being off, which in turn directly affects the ground. Since the ground is not being directly watered by rain during a dry season, and the sprinkler is off, the ground will not be wet.<|eot_id|>",
