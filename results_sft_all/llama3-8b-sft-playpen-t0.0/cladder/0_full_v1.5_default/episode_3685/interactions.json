The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 26%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 40%. Does education level positively affect black hair through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of black hair among those with a college degree or higher is higher than among those without a college degree, which might imply a direct positive effect of education on black hair. The intervening role of skill is not sufficient to account for this difference, as the probability of black hair among those with a college degree or higher is still lower than the probability of black hair among those with a college degree or higher who have a high skill level (40% vs. 100%).||",
