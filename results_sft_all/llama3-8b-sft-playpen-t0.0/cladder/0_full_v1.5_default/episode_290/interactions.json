The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 42%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 62%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 31%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of Alice waking up on time is 1 - 0.42 = 0.58, and the probability of arriving on time given that she wakes up on time is 0.62. The probability of Alice waking up late is 0.42, and the probability of arriving on time given that she wakes up late is 0.31. The overall probability of arriving on time is (0.58 * 0.62) + (0.42 * 0.31) = 0.3594 + 0.1302 = 0.4896. The probability of arriving late is 1 - 0.4896 = 0.5104. Since 0.4896 is less than 0.5104, it is more likely that Alice will arrive to school late than on time.||",
