Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 67%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 80%. For people who have a brother, would it be more likely to see high salary if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the positive effect of having a brother on salary is entirely mediated through the increase in skill. Since the person in question already has a brother, their skill is higher than it would be if they did not have a brother. The additional positive effect of not having a brother on their skill is not present in this scenario, so the person's higher skill and subsequent higher salary are entirely due to having a brother.<|eot_id|>",
