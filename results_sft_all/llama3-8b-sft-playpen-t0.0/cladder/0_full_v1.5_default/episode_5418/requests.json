Effort has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of smoking is 82%. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 32%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 44%. Is freckles less likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between effort and freckles is that higher effort is associated with higher probability of freckles. The direct relationship between smoking and effort is that smoking is associated with lower effort. Since the probability of smoking is 82%, the overall probability of freckles is higher than the probability of no freckles, which is 18%.<|eot_id|>",
