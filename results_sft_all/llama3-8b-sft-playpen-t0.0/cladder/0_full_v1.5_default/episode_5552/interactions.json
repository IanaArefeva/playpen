The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on full moon and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on full moon. Full moon has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how full moon correlates with price in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to demand. To understand how full moon affects price, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the absence of control over demand, looking at the general correlation between full moon and price (Method 1) could lead to spurious conclusions about the direct relationship between full moon and price. This is because demand could be driving both the full moon and price variations, creating a spurious positive relationship between them. In contrast, looking at the relationship between full moon and price on a case-by-case basis according to demand (Method 2) would control for demand and provide a more accurate picture of the direct relationship between full moon and price.||",
