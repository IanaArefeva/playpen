The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes manager not signing the termination letter and director signing the termination letter. manager signing the termination letter and director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to fire the employee. Would the employee is fired if manager not signing the termination letter instead of manager signing the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The CEO's decision to fire the employee directly affects the manager and the director, leading them to sign the termination letter (with the manager not signing and the director signing in the case of the CEO's decision to fire). The subsequent actions of the manager and the director on the employee are separate from the direct effect of the CEO's decision. If the manager not sign the termination letter, it would still lead to the director sign the letter, and the direct effect of the CEO's decision on the manager and the director would still lead to the employee being fired.||",
