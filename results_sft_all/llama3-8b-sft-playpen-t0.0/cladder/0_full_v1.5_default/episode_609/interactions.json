The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how education level correlates with salary case by case according to unobserved confounders. Method 2: We look directly at how education level correlates with salary in general. To understand how education level affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is a classic case of confounding bias, where the observed relationship between two variables is distorted by the presence of an unobserved third variable that affects both variables. In such a situation, looking at the general correlation between education level and salary (Method 2) would lead to an incorrect conclusion about the causal relationship between the two variables. In contrast, looking at the relationship between education level and salary case by case according to the unobserved confounders (Method 1) would account for the confounding bias and provide a more accurate picture of the causal relationship between the two variables.||",
