The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 79%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 72%. Will obesity increase the chance of long lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of diabetes on lifespan is also positive, meaning that having diabetes directly leads to a lower chance of having a long lifespan. Since the direct effect of obesity on diabetes is positive and the direct effect of diabetes on lifespan is also positive, the overall effect of obesity on lifespan is negative. This is because the positive direct effect of obesity on diabetes is counteracted by the positive direct effect of diabetes on lifespan, leading to a net negative effect of obesity on lifespan.||",
