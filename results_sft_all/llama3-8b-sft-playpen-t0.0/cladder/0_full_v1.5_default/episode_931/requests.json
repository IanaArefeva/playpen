Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 79%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 72%.

The direct effect of diabetes on lifespan is also positive, meaning that having diabetes directly leads to a lower chance of having a long lifespan. Since the direct effect of obesity on diabetes is positive and the direct effect of diabetes on lifespan is also positive, the overall effect of obesity on lifespan is negative. This is because the positive direct effect of obesity on diabetes is counteracted by the positive direct effect of diabetes on lifespan, leading to a net negative effect of obesity on lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
