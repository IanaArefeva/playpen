The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. We know that smoking mother and good health causes normal infant birth weight. smoking mother or good health or normal infant birth weight causes high infant mortality. We observed the person has poor health. Would infant mortality is low if nonsmoking mother instead of smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A smoking mother still has a direct effect on birth weight and infant mortality, and the person's health condition is unobserved. Since we already know that the person has poor health, we can conclude that the person's birth weight is likely to be lower than normal. A lower birth weight directly affects infant mortality, so the person's infant mortality is likely to be higher than normal. A smoking mother further increases the risk of higher infant mortality. In this scenario, the person's birth weight is already lower than normal due to their health condition, and a smoking mother would further increase the risk of higher infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
