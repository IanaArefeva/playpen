The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 13%. The probability of not liking spicy food and high salary is 40%. The probability of liking spicy food and high salary is 4%. Is the chance of high salary larger when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of not liking spicy food and having a high salary is 40%, which is higher than the probability of liking spicy food and having a high salary (4%). This suggests that not liking spicy food is associated with a higher chance of having a high salary, which in turn means that the chance of high salary is larger when not observing liking spicy food.||",
