The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 13%. The probability of non-male gender and high salary is 41%. The probability of male gender and high salary is 5%. Is the chance of high salary larger when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of male gender and high salary is 5%, which is lower than the probability of non-male gender and high salary (41%). This suggests that male gender is associated with lower rather than higher chances of high salary.<|eot_id|>",
