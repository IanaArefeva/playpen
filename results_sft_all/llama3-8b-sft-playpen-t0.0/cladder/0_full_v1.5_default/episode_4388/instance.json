Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 16%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 93%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 23%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 50%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 12%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 38%. The overall probability of smoking is 50%. Does smoking negatively affect peanut allergy through tar deposit?",
