The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 81%. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 85%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 65%. Is high infant mortality less likely than low infant mortality overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of having a sister is 81%, this means that a large majority of infants (81%) have a lower risk of high infant mortality compared to those without a sister (19%). This indicates that high infant mortality is less likely than low infant mortality overall, as the majority of the population (81%) is protected from this risk by having a sister.||",
