The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 49%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 39%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 4%. Is arriving to school on time less likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
