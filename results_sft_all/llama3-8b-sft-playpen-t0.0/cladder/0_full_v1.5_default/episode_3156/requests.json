Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 58%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 61%. Will drinking coffee increase the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of the wife on the alarm clock is also positive, meaning that if the wife is present, the probability of the alarm ringing is higher than if she is not. Since the direct effect of coffee on the alarm clock is positive and the direct effect of the wife on the alarm clock is also positive, we need to consider the interaction between these two direct effects. If the direct effect of the wife on the alarm clock is strong enough, it could potentially counteract the positive direct effect of coffee on the alarm clock, leading to a net negative effect of coffee on the probability of the alarm ringing.<|eot_id|>",
