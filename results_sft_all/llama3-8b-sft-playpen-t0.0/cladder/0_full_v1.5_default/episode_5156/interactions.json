The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Brown eyes has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 95%. For students who are not talented, the probability of brown eyes is 82%. For students who are talented, the probability of brown eyes is 82%. Is brown eyes more likely than blue eyes overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the overall probability of brown eyes is primarily determined by the high probability of being talented, which is 95%. Since the probability of brown eyes is the same for both talented and non-talented students, and the probability of being talented is so high, the overall probability of brown eyes is likely to be close to the probability of being talented, which is 95%. In this case, the probability of brown eyes is not higher than the probability of being blue eyes, which is 5% (100% - 95%).||",
