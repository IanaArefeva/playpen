The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active or high cigarette tax causes smoking mother. confounder active or smoking mother causes normal infant birth weight. We observed the cigarette tax is low and confounder active. Would the infant is born with a normal weight if nonsmoking mother instead of smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the confounder is active, it will lead to a smoking mother, and this smoking mother will then lead to a normal birth weight for the infant. The cigarette tax being low does not directly influence the birth weight of the infant, as its primary effect is on the maternal smoking status, which is already determined by the active confounder.<|eot_id|>",
