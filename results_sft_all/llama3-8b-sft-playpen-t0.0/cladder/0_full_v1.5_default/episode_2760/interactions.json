The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 23%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 46%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 32%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 67%. Will smoking mother decrease the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both maternal smoking and birth weight, which could imply that areas with higher unobserved confounders are more likely to have both higher birth weight and higher smoking rates. The cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking, which could imply that areas with higher cigarette tax are more likely to have lower birth weight and lower smoking rates. The given probabilities of normal birth weight and smoking mother in areas with different cigarette tax levels support this interpretation: areas with high cigarette tax have higher normal birth weight (46%) and lower smoking (67%) than areas with low cigarette tax (23% and 32%, respectively).||",
