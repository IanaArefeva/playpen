The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 3%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 51%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 2%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of high rainfall is higher when Alice wakes up on time (51%) than when she wakes up late (2%). This suggests that the relationship between Alice's wake-up time and rainfall is not direct, and there might be an intervening variable (such as the time of day or the weather patterns) that affects both the probability of Alice's wake-up time and the probability of high rainfall. The direct relationship between Alice's wake-up time and rainfall is not immediately obvious from the given information, and we should be cautious not to overinterpret the available data.||",
