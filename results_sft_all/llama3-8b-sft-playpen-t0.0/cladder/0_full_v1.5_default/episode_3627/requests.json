Lip thickness has a direct effect on fame. For people who are famous, the correlation between attractive appearance and thick lips is -0.06. If we look at people who are famous, does it mean that attractive appearance does not affect thick lips?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between these two variables is still direct, and the negative correlation could be due to the fact that famous people with thick lips are less likely to have an attractive appearance, or that famous people with an attractive appearance are less likely to have thick lips. The direct effect of appearance on thick lips remains, and the negative correlation among famous people does not cancel this direct effect.<|eot_id|>",
