The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 65%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 37%. For infants with smoking mothers, would it be less likely to see high infant mortality if the infant had a nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The health condition is unobserved, so we can't conclude that the health condition is the same for both scenarios. If the health condition is different for the two scenarios, then the different birth weights and subsequent infant mortalities would still be primarily due to the direct effects of the health condition and the direct effect of the health condition on birth weight and subsequent infant mortality, rather than the difference in the direct effect of the health condition on birth weight and subsequent infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
