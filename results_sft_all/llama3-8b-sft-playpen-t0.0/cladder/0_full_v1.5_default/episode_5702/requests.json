The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 59%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 43%. Will having a sister decrease the chance of high infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The health condition, being unobserved, likely exerts a positive effect on birth weight and a negative effect on infant mortality, further muddling the relationship between having a sister and infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
