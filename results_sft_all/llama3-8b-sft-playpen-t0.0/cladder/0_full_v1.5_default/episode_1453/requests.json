The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 98%. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 51%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 63%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 17%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 36%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 93%. If we disregard the mediation effect through wife, would husband negatively affect alarm clock?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the scenarios where the husband sets the alarm, the probability of the alarm ringing is higher than in the scenarios where the husband doesn't set the alarm. This suggests that the husband's action of setting the alarm has a positive effect on the alarm clock.<|eot_id|>",
