The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 66%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 81%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of not listening to jazz on lung cancer is also positive (66% vs an unobserved probability for those who do), which means that not listening to jazz is associated with a higher risk of lung cancer. Since the direct effect of not listening to jazz on lung cancer is positive, it is not less likely to see lung cancer if the person does not listen to jazz.<|eot_id|>",
