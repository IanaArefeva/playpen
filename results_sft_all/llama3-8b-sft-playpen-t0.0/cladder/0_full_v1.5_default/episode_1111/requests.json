The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 4%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 34%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 62%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 94%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 42%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the large kidney stone condition itself is associated with a higher probability of recovery, rather than the absence of treatment. In particular, for patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 62%, which is higher than the 34% probability of recovery for small kidney stone patients who do receive treatment. This indicates that the large kidney stone condition is a more significant factor in determining the probability of recovery than the absence of treatment.<|eot_id|>",
