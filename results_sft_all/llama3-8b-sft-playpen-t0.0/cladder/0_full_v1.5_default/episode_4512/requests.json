Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 12%. The probability of not listening to jazz and lung cancer is 30%. The probability of listening to jazz and lung cancer is 8%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing listening to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer given that one is not listening to jazz is 30%. The probability of lung cancer given that one is listening to jazz is the same as the probability of lung cancer given that one is not listening to jazz, which is 30%. This is because the direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is through the intermediate variable \"tar deposit\", and the probability of lung cancer given that one is not listening to jazz is the same as the probability of lung cancer given that one is not \"tar deposit\" (since the probability of \"tar deposit\" given that one is not \"jazz\" is the same as the probability of \"tar deposit\" given that one is not \"jazz\" and \"lung cancer\" is conditionally independent of \"jazz\" given \"tar deposit\" and \"not \"jazz\" and \"not \"lung cancer\" is conditionally independent of \"jazz\" given \"tar deposit\" and \"not \"jazz\" and \"not \"lung cancer\" is conditionally independent of \"jazz\" given \"tar deposit\" and \"not \"jazz\" and \"not \"lung cancer\" is conditionally independent of \"jazz\" given \"tar deposit\" and \"not \"jazz\" and \"not \"lung cancer\" is conditionally independent of \"jazz\" given \"tar deposit\" and \"not \"jazz\" and",
