The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on black hair. Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of black hair is 74%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of black hair is 17%. For people who went to tanning salons, would it be less likely to see black hair if the person had not had a tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
