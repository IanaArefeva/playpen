The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 47%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 50%. For infants with smoking mothers, would it be less likely to see high infant mortality if the infant had a nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The health condition is unobserved, so we can't directly account for its influence. The birth weight of an infant with a smoking mother is likely to be lower than that of an infant with a nonsmoking mother, which in turn would lead to a higher probability of high infant mortality. The additional 3% increase in the probability of high infant mortality for an infant with a smoking mother compared to an infant with a nonsmoking mother is not a direct result of the health condition, but rather a separate effect of the maternal smoking on the birth weight and subsequent infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
