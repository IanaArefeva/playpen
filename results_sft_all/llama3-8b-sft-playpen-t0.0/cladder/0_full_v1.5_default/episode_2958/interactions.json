The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender and in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the resident is in-state. Would the applicant gets admitted if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that in-state residency is a cause of competitive department, and we also know that male gender and in-state residency together cause competitive department, we can conclude that male gender is not a necessary condition for a competitive department when in-state residency is present. In other words, the direct effect of male gender on competitive department is conditionally dependent on in-state residency. If we condition on in-state residency, the direct effect of male gender on competitive department is neutralized, and the direct effect of in-state residency on competitive department remains. Since we already know that in-state residency is a cause of competitive department, and we also know that in-state residency is a cause of admission acceptance, we can conclude that the applicant will get admitted if non-male gender instead of male gender, conditionally on in-state residency.||",
