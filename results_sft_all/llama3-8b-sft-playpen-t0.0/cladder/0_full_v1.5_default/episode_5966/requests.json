The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. We know that having a sister causes the corporal shooting and the private not shooting. the corporal shooting or the private shooting causes the prisoner's death. Would the prisoner is dead if not having a sister instead of having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of the corporal shooting is that the prisoner is dead, and the direct effect of the private not shooting is that the prisoner is not dead. Since having a sister leads to the corporal shooting and the private not shooting, and the corporal's action directly leads to the prisoner's death, the absence of having a sister would lead to the corporal not shooting and the private still not shooting, which in turn would lead to the prisoner not being dead.<|eot_id|>",
