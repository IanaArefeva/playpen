Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes sufficient vitamin C, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes scurvy.

Since citrus directly affects vitamin C, and vitamin C directly affects scurvy, we can conclude that citrus is a cause of scurvy. If citrus is present, it will lead to an increase in vitamin C, which in turn will lead to scurvy. If citrus is absent, it will lead to a decrease in vitamin C, which in turn will lead to a reduction in scurvy. In this case, the absence of citrus is the cause of scurvy, not the citrus itself.<|eot_id|>",
