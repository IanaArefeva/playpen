The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 1%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 21%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 90%. The overall probability of male gender is 50%. For patients who have a brother, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of recovery is 90% for male patients with a brother and 21% for female patients with a brother. Since the probability of male gender is 50%, we can conclude that the probability of having a male sibling is also 50%. In this case, the higher probability of recovery among male patients with a brother (90%) compared to female patients with a brother (21%) is primarily due to the direct effect of male gender on recovery rather than the direct effect of having a brother on recovery.||",
