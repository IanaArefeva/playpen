Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 99%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 87%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 30%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 19%. The overall probability of old age is 47%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?",
