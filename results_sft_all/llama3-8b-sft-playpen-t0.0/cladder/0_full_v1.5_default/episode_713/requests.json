Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 60%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 57%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 68%.

Additionally, the direct relationship between department competitiveness and admission acceptance further indicates that higher department competitiveness is associated with higher probability of admission acceptance. Since male gender is more likely than non-male gender (60% vs 40%), and higher department competitiveness is associated with higher probability of admission acceptance, it is likely that male students in more competitive departments have higher probability of admission acceptance than others. This could lead to a higher overall probability of admission acceptance for male students than for non-male students, which in turn could lead to a higher overall probability of admission acceptance than rejection.<|eot_id|>",
