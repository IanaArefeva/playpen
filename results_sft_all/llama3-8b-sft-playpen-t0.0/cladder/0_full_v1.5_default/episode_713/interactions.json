The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 60%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 57%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 68%. Is admission acceptance more likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Additionally, the direct relationship between department competitiveness and admission acceptance further indicates that higher department competitiveness is associated with higher probability of admission acceptance. Since male gender is more likely than non-male gender (60% vs 40%), and higher department competitiveness is associated with higher probability of admission acceptance, it is likely that male students in more competitive departments have higher probability of admission acceptance than others. This could lead to a higher overall probability of admission acceptance for male students than for non-male students, which in turn could lead to a higher overall probability of admission acceptance than rejection.||",
