Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 76%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin death is 49%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin death is 41%. Is penguin death less likely than penguin lives overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of taking the stairs is 24% (100% - 76%) and the probability of taking the elevator is 76%, we can weight the probabilities of penguin death by the corresponding probabilities of taking the stairs and the elevator. The overall probability of penguin death is then (0.24 * 0.49) + (0.76 * 0.41) = 0.1176 + 0.3116 = 0.4292. The probability of penguin lives is 1 - 0.4292 = 0.5708. Since 0.5708 is greater than 0.4292, penguin death is less likely than penguin lives overall.<|eot_id|>",
