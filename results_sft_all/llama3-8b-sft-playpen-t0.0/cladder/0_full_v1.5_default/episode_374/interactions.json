The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and penguin survival. Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 76%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin death is 49%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin death is 41%. Is penguin death less likely than penguin lives overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of taking the stairs is 24% (100% - 76%) and the probability of taking the elevator is 76%, we can weight the probabilities of penguin death by the corresponding probabilities of taking the stairs and the elevator. The overall probability of penguin death is then (0.24 * 0.49) + (0.76 * 0.41) = 0.1176 + 0.3116 = 0.4292. The probability of penguin lives is 1 - 0.4292 = 0.5708. Since 0.5708 is greater than 0.4292, penguin death is less likely than penguin lives overall.||",
