The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Brown eyes has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Method 1: We look at how talent correlates with brown eyes case by case according to elite institution admission status. Method 2: We look directly at how talent correlates with brown eyes in general. To understand how talent affects brown eyes, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because we are looking to establish a direct relationship between two variables (talent and brown eyes) through a third variable (elite institution admission status), which is a common practice in causal inference known as instrumental variable analysis. In this case, the instrumental variable is the elite institution admission status, which affects both the outcome of interest (brown eyes) and the treatment variable (talent), but does not directly cause the outcome. Method 1 involves looking at the relationship between the instrumental variable and the two variables of interest (talent and brown eyes) to establish a causal link between them. Method 2, on the other hand, involves looking at the general relationship between the two variables of interest (talent and brown eyes), which does not account for the instrumental variable and its role in mediating the relationship between the two variables.||",
