The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 31%. For people who have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 75%. For people who have a sister, would it be less likely to see the prisoner's death if the person did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that having a sister directly increases the probability of the prisoner's death by 44%. If we condition on the absence of a sister, the direct effect of the absence of a sister on the probability of the prisoner's death is still 0, since the absence of a sister does not directly affect the probability of the prisoner's death. The only difference is that the counterfactual probability of the prisoner's death in the absence of a sister is now 31% rather than the counterfactual probability of the prisoner's death in the absence of a sister for people who have a sister, which is still 31%.||",
