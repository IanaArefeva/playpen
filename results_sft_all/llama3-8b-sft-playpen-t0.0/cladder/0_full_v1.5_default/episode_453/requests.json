The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 66%. For people not taking any medication and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 36%. For people taking medication and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 92%. For people taking medication and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 70%. For people not taking any medication, the probability of high blood pressure is 63%. For people taking medication, the probability of high blood pressure is 22%. If we disregard the mediation effect through blood pressure, would medication negatively affect heart condition?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
