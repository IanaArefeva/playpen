Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 50%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 73%. Will listening to jazz increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key insight here is that the direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is not the primary cause of the increase in lung cancer risk. The correct chain of causality is: jazz affects the probability of lung cancer through its direct effect on the probability of having a higher risk of lung cancer, which in turn affects the probability of having lung cancer. The direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is not the primary cause of the increase in lung cancer risk. The correct chain of causality is: jazz affects the probability of having a higher risk of lung cancer, which in turn affects the probability of having lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
