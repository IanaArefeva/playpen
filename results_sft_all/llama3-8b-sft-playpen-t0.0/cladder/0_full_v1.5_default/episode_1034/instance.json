Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 56%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 71%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 41%. Is increased price less likely than reduced price overall?",
