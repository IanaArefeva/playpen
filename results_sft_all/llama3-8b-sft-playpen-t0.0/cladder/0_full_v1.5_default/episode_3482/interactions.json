The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%. Will tanning salon treatment increase the chance of large feet?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The beach visitation has a direct and more significant effect on foot size, and its relationship with large feet is not fully accounted for in the given information. The probability of large feet among beach visitors is not provided, which hinders a complete understanding of the beach's role in foot size variations. The tanning salon's direct effect on foot size is not strong enough to conclude that it would increase the chance of large feet, especially when compared to the beach's likely more substantial influence.||",
