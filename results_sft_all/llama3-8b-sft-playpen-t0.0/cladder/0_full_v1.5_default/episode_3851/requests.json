Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 61%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 39%.

This relationship is not inverted, meaning that male gender does not increase the chance of being allergic to peanuts.<|eot_id|>",
