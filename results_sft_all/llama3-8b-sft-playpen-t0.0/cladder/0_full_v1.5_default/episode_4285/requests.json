The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 44%. For people refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 68%. For people getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 40%. Is being lactose intolerant more likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of being lactose intolerant is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is (0.4 * 0.56) + (0.68 * 0.44) = 0.448, which is less than 0.5.<|eot_id|>",
