The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how maternal smoking status correlates with infant mortality case by case according to infant's birth weight. Method 2: We look directly at how maternal smoking status correlates with infant mortality in general. To understand how maternal smoking status affects infant mortality, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the relationship between maternal smoking and infant mortality is not direct but rather through the intervening variable of birth weight. Method 1, which controls for birth weight, is more appropriate than Method 2, which does not account for this intervening variable.||",
