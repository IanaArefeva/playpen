The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 3%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 13%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 78%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 91%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 42%. Will receives treatment decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of large kidney stone with treatment is 42% and the probability of recovery for large kidney stone with treatment is 91%. The difference in probability of recovery between large kidney stone with and without treatment is 13% (91% - 78%). The probability of small kidney stone is 58%, and the probability of recovery for small kidney stone without treatment is 3%. The probability of small kidney stone with treatment is 58% and the probability of recovery for small kidney stone with treatment is 13%. The difference in probability of recovery between small kidney stone with and without treatment is 10% (13% - 3%). Since the difference in probability of recovery between large kidney stone with and without treatment is larger than the difference in probability of recovery between small kidney stone with and without treatment, Will's chance of recovery is higher if he has a large kidney stone than if he has a small kidney stone, and Will's chance of recovery is higher if he is not receiving treatment than if he is.<|eot_id|>",
