Since the hospital bill is already accounted for by the patient's age, the hospital bill does not play a role in the patient's recovery. The direct effect of hospital costs on recovery is also not relevant here since the hospital costs are already determined by the patient's age. The only remaining relationship is that old age or high hospital bill causes recovery, and since the patient is old, the high hospital bill condition is not necessary for the patient to recover.<|eot_id|>",
