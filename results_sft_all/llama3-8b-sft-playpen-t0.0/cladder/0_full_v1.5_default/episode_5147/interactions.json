The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 80%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 14%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 28%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the relationship between college degree and large feet is not a direct one, but rather an indirect relationship through the unobserved confounder. The unobserved confounder likely has a positive effect on both college degree and large feet, which is why we see a higher probability of large feet when college degree or higher is the case.||",
