Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 47%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 11%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 71%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 40%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 41%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 57%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 89%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 82%. The overall probability of confounder active is 56%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?",
