The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 35%. The probability of vaccine refusal and being lactose intolerant is 40%. The probability of getting the vaccine and being lactose intolerant is 9%. Is the chance of being lactose intolerant larger when observing getting the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between \"vaccination\" and \"lactose intolerance\" is that the vaccine can reduce the likelihood of being lactose intolerant. This means that if someone is vaccinated, they are less likely to be lactose intolerant.\n2. The probability of being both vaccinated and lactose intolerant is 9%, which is lower than the probability of being vaccine-refused and lactose intolerant (40%).\n3. The probability of being vaccine-refused and lactose intolerant is higher than the probability of being both vaccinated and lactose intolerant, which further supports the idea that being vaccine-refused is associated with a higher likelihood of being lactose intolerant.\n4. The direct relationship between \"pre-conditions\" and \"vaccination\" is that the pre-conditions can lead to a higher likelihood of being vaccinated, which in turn can reduce the likelihood of being lactose intolerant.\n5. The probability of being vaccine-refused and lactose intolerant is higher than the probability of being both vaccinated and lactose intolerant, which further supports the idea that being vaccine-refused is associated with a higher likelihood of being lactose intolerant.\n6.
