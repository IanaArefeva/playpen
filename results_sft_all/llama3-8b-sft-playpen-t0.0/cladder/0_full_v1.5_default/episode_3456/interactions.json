The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Method 1: We look at how solar eclipse correlates with Alice arriving to school case by case according to traffic. Method 2: We look directly at how solar eclipse correlates with Alice arriving to school in general. To understand how solar eclipse affects Alice arriving to school, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because we are looking for the direct effect of the solar eclipse on Alice's arrival to school, and we want to control for the intervening variable (traffic) that could otherwise confound the relationship. In this case, looking at the general relationship between solar eclipse and Alice's arrival to school (Method 2) will give us a more accurate measure of the direct effect of the solar eclipse, rather than relying on case-by-case correlations that might be influenced by variations in traffic (Method 1).||",
