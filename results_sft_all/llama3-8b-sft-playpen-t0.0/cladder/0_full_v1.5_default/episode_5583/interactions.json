The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and peanut allergy. Treatment has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of receives treatment is 45%. The probability of receives no treatment and being allergic to peanuts is 15%. The probability of receives treatment and being allergic to peanuts is 31%. Is the chance of being allergic to peanuts smaller when observing receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the absence of treatment is associated with a higher likelihood of having a peanut allergy. The direct relationship between the person's gender and the probability of having a peanut allergy is not clear from the information, and the direct relationship between the person's gender and the probability of being treated is also not clear. The only clear direct relationship is that the person is more likely to have a peanut allergy if they are not treated.||",
