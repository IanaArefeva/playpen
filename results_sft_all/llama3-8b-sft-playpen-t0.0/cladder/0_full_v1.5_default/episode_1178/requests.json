The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 52%. For people refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 67%. For people getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 22%. Is recovering from the disease more likely than dying from the disease overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a person being unvaccinated is 48%. The probability of a person being unvaccinated and then recovering from the disease is 0.48 * 0.67 = 0.32. The probability of a person being unvaccinated and then dying from the disease is 0.48 * (1 - 0.67) = 0.16. The probability of a person being vaccinated and then recovering from the disease is 0.52 * 0.22 = 0.11. The probability of a person being vaccinated and then dying from the disease is 0.52 * (1 - 0.22) = 0.40. The total probability of a person in this world recovering from the disease is 0.32 + 0.11 = 0.43. The total probability of a person in this world dying from the disease is 0.16 + 0.40 = 0.56. Since 0.43 is less than 0.56, it is more likely that a person in this world will die from the disease than that they will recover from the disease.<|eot_id|>",
