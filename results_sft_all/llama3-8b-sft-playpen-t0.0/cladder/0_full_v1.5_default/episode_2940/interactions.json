The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. We know that male gender causes non-competitive department. male gender and competitive department causes admission acceptance. Would the applicant gets admitted if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between male gender and non-competitive department supersedes the relationship between male gender and competitive department, which is only active when the applicant is in a competitive department. Since the direct relationship between male gender and non-competitive department is active in this case, the applicant will be in a non-competitive department, which will lead to a lower chance of admission.||",
