The direct relationship between male gender and non-competitive department supersedes the relationship between male gender and competitive department, which is only active when the applicant is in a competitive department. Since the direct relationship between male gender and non-competitive department is active in this case, the applicant will be in a non-competitive department, which will lead to a lower chance of admission.<|eot_id|>",
