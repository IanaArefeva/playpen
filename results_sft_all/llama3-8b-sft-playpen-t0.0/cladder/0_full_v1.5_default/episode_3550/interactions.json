The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of having a brother is 74%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 55%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 68%. Is smallpox survival less likely than smallpox death overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Additionally, the direct relationship between vaccination reaction and smallpox survival is also positive, as a positive vaccination reaction likely leads to higher smallpox survival. The direct relationship between having a brother and smallpox is also positive, as having a brother directly affects the probability of smallpox. Since all direct relationships are positive, we conclude that smallpox survival is more likely than smallpox death overall.||",
