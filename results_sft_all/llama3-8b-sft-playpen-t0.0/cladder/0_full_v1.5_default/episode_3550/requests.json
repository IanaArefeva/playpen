The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of having a brother is 74%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 55%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 68%. Is smallpox survival less likely than smallpox death overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Additionally, the direct relationship between vaccination reaction and smallpox survival is also positive, as a positive vaccination reaction likely leads to higher smallpox survival. The direct relationship between having a brother and smallpox is also positive, as having a brother directly affects the probability of smallpox. Since all direct relationships are positive, we conclude that smallpox survival is more likely than smallpox death overall.<|eot_id|>",
