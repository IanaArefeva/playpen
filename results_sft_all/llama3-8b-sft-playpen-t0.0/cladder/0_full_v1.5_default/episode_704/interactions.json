The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 51%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 47%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 63%. Is admission acceptance more likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Additionally, the direct relationship between department competitiveness and higher probability of admission acceptance further solidifies this positive relationship. Since the probability of male gender is 51%, this means that more than half of the population is male, and as a result, more than half of the population will have a higher probability of admission acceptance. This, in turn, means that the overall probability of admission acceptance is higher than the probability of admission rejection.||",
