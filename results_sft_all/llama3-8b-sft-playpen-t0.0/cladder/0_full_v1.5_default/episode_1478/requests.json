The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 5%. For people not blowing out candles, the probability of dark room is 84%. For people who blow out candles, the probability of dark room is 50%. Is dark room more likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of blowing out the candle is 5%, the overall probability of dark room is (0.05 * 0.5) + (0.95 * 0.84) = 0.419, which is less than the probability of bright room (1 - 0.419 = 0.581).<|eot_id|>",
