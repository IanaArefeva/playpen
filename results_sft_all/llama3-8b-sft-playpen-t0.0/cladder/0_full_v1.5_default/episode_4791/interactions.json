The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on rainfall. Sprinkler has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of rainy season is 99%. The probability of dry season and high rainfall is 1%. The probability of rainy season and high rainfall is 57%. Is the chance of high rainfall larger when observing rainy season?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The 1% probability of a dry season and high rainfall, and the 57% probability of a rainy season and high rainfall, indicate that there are multiple scenarios where high rainfall can occur. The 99% probability of a rainy season does not imply that the chance of high rainfall is larger when observing a rainy season, as the additional direct relationship between the sprinkler and rainfall could still lead to high rainfall in a dry season.||",
