The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of having a sister is 7%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 62%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 45%. Is healthy heart less likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The blood pressure condition also exerts a direct effect on heart condition. Since having a sister directly affects blood pressure, which in turn affects heart condition, we must consider the joint effect of these two intervening variables. The probability of having a heart condition is not only determined by having a sister; the blood pressure condition also plays a role. The joint probability of having a heart condition and having a sister is not directly provided, so we must carefully consider the relationships between these variables. The correct answer is \"No\" since we need to account for the intervening role of blood pressure in the relationship between having a sister and heart condition.||",
