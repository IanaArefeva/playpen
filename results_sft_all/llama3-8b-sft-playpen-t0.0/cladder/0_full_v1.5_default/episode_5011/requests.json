Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 62%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 55%.

This suggests that having a sister is associated with a higher risk of heart condition. The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is also positive, meaning that higher blood pressure is associated with a higher risk of heart condition. Since having a sister is associated with higher blood pressure (as it directly affects blood pressure), this further increases the risk of heart condition.<|eot_id|>",
