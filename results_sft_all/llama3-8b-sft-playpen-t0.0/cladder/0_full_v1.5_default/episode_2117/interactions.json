The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 15%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 74%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 21%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, the direct relationship between male gender and lower department competitiveness could counteract this effect. If male gender is associated with lower department competitiveness, which in turn is associated with lower admission probability, then the overall probability of admission acceptance might still be higher than that of rejection.||",
