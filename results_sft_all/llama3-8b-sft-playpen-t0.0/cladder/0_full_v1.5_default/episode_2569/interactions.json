The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 81%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and high infant mortality is 13%. The probability of smoking mother and high infant mortality is 44%. Is the chance of high infant mortality smaller when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between health condition and both birth weight and infant mortality is also clear. The direct relationship between birth weight and infant mortality is also clear. The key point here is that the health condition is unobserved, and its direct relationship with both birth weight and infant mortality is not accounted for in the given probabilities. The probability of high infant mortality given a smoking mother is 44%, which is higher than the probability of high infant mortality given a nonsmoking mother (13%). This suggests that the direct relationship between maternal smoking and infant's birth weight and infant mortality might not fully account for the observed differences in infant mortality between smoking and nonsmoking mothers. The unobserved health condition could be a confounding variable that affects both birth weight and infant mortality, and its presence could lead to a higher probability of high infant mortality among smoking mothers than among nonsmoking mothers.||",
