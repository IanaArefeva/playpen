The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 75%. The probability of reduced supply and increased price is 20%. The probability of increased supply and increased price is 45%. Is the chance of increased price larger when observing increased supply?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The 75% probability of increased supply can be broken down into two scenarios: (1) demand is high and yield per acre is also high, leading to an increase in both demand and yield per acre, which in turn cause an increase in supply and price; and (2) demand is high but yield per acre is low, leading to an increase in demand and a corresponding reduction in yield per acre, which in turn lead to a reduction in supply and an increase in price.\nIn the first scenario, the increase in demand directly leads to an increase in price, and the increase in yield per acre directly leads to an increase in supply. In the second scenario, the increase in demand directly leads to an increase in price, and the reduction in yield per acre directly leads to a reduction in supply.\nGiven that the probability of demand being high is not directly observable, we must consider the joint probability of demand and yield per acre. The 45% probability of both increased supply and price can be seen as a joint effect of demand and yield per acre, where demand is high and yield per acre is also high, leading to an increase in both demand and yield per acre, which in turn cause an increase in supply and price.\nThe 20% probability of both reduced supply and price can be seen as a",
