The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 12%. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 71%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 33%. Is long lifespan more likely than short lifespan overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of long lifespan is lower than that of short lifespan, as the higher probability of short lifespan among the obese (67%) far outweighs the higher probability of long lifespan among the normal weight (71%).<|eot_id|>",
