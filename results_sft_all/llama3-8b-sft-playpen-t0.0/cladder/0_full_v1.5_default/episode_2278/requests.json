The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 92%. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 47%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 45%. Is college admission more likely than college rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of college admission is lower for smokers than for nonsmokers, and the probability of smoking is 92%, the overall probability of college admission is less than the overall probability of college rejection.<|eot_id|>",
