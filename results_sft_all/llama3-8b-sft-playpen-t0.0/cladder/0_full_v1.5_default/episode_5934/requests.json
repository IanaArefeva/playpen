The candle has a direct effect on room. We know that liking spicy food or candle with wax causes dark room. We observed the candle has wax.

The direct effect of the candle on room is also that the room is dark. Since we already know that the room is dark (caused by the candle), the additional condition of \"liking spicy food\" does not change the state of the room. The room remains dark.<|eot_id|>",
