Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active and close to a college causes drinking coffee. confounder active or drinking coffee causes high salary. We observed the person lives close to a college and confounder active.

Since we already know that the person is close to a college and the confounder is active, we can conclude that the confounder is the primary cause of their high salary. If the person were not drinking coffee, it's still likely that the active unobserved confounder would lead to a high salary, as the confounder's direct effect on salary is not dependent on the person's behavior of drinking coffee.<|eot_id|>",
