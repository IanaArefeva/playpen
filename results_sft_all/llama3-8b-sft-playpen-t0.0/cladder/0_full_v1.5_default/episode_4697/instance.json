  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 96%. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 57%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 52%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 10%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 30%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 36%. For managers who sign termination letters, would it be less likely to see large feet if the manager had signed the termination letter?",
