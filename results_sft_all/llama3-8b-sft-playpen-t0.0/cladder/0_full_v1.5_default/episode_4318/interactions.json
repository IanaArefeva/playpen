The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 42%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 75%. For infants with smoking mothers, would it be more likely to see freckles if the infant had a nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The birth weight of the infant is also directly related to both the maternal smoking status and the probability of freckles, with higher birth weight associated with lower probability of freckles. The health condition is unobserved, and its direct relationship with both birth weight and freckles is not quantified. The direct relationship between birth weight and the probability of freckles is also established, with higher birth weight associated with lower probability of freckles. In this context, the probability of freckles among infants with smoking mothers is already higher than among those with nonsmoking mothers, and the birth weight of the infant does not directly influence the probability of freckles in the presence of maternal smoking.||",
