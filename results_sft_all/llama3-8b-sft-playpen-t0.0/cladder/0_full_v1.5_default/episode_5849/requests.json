The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of having a sister is 82%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 73%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that a large majority of the population (82%) has a higher risk of lung cancer (73%) compared to those without a sister (33%). Since the overall probability of having a sister is so high, the overall risk of lung cancer is likely to be higher than the risk of absence of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
