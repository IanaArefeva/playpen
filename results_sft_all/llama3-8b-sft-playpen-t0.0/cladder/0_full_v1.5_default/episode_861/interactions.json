The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 31%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 68%. For children with intelligent parents, would it be less likely to see intelligent child if the child had unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key point here is that the parents' intelligence directly affects the child's intelligence, and the social status of the parents also directly affects the child's intelligence. Since the child's intelligence is directly determined by the parents' intelligence, the social status of the parents does not play a role in this specific relationship. The social status of the parents is only an intervening variable that affects the child's intelligence through the parents' intelligence. In this case, the parents' social status does not directly influence the child's intelligence, so the probability of an intelligent child given that the child has intelligent parents is not less likely than the probability of an intelligent child given that the child has unintelligent parents.||",
