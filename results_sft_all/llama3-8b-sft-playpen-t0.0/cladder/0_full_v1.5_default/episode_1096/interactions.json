The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. Method 1: We look at how hospital costs correlates with recovery case by case according to age. Method 2: We look directly at how hospital costs correlates with recovery in general. To understand how hospital costs affects recovery, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In other words, hospital costs directly affects recovery, and this relationship is not being confounded by the individual's age. In this case, looking at the general relationship between hospital costs and recovery (Method 2) is more appropriate than looking at the relationship on a case-by-case basis according to age (Method 1), as the direct effect of hospital costs on recovery is not being confounded by the individual's age.||",
