The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and foot size. Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of large feet is 67%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of large feet is 67%. Will taking the elevator increase the chance of large feet?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
