The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and rainfall. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how supply correlates with rainfall in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to demand. To understand how supply affects rainfall, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The demand is unobserved, and we are focusing on the relationship between supply and rainfall. In this specific context, looking at the general correlation between supply and rainfall (Method 1) is more appropriate than looking at this relationship case by case according to demand (Method 2), as the demand is unobserved and does not directly influence the relationship between supply and rainfall.<|eot_id|>",
