The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking gene is 98%. The probability of nonsmoking gene and lung cancer is 1%. The probability of smoking gene and lung cancer is 70%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing smoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The \"smoking\" condition is a direct cause of \"lung cancer\" only through the \"smoking\" condition, not through the \"gene\" condition. The \"gene\" condition is a direct cause of \"smoking\" and \"lung cancer\" through separate relationships. The \"pollution\" condition is a direct cause of both \"smoking\" and \"lung cancer\" and is unobserved. The \"nonsmoking\" condition is a direct cause of \"lung cancer\" with a probability of 1%. The \"smoking\" condition is a direct cause of \"lung cancer\" with a probability of 70%. The \"gene\" condition is a direct cause of \"smoking\" with a probability of 98%.
