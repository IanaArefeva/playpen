The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not have a brother and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 59%. For people who do not have a brother and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 39%. For people who have a brother and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 59%. For people who have a brother and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. For people who do not have a brother and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 87%. For people who do not have a brother and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 57%. For people who have a brother and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 52%. For people who have a brother and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 28%. The overall probability of high pollution is 49%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would having a brother negatively affect lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
