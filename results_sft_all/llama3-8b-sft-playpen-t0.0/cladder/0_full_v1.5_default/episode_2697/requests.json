Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 16%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 54%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 13%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer given smoking is higher than the probability of lung cancer given nonsmoking, which is a sign of positive confounding. This means that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not direct and that there is an unobserved common cause that is associated with both smoking and lung cancer, which is the tar deposit. The higher probability of lung cancer given smoking compared to the probability of lung cancer given nonsmoking is a sign of positive confounding, which means that the chance of lung cancer is larger when observing smoking.<|eot_id|>",
