  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 26%. For individuals who are not male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 61%. For individuals who are male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 55%. For individuals who are male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 68%. For individuals who are not male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 40%. For individuals who are not male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 15%. For individuals who are male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 2%. For individuals who are male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 24%. The overall probability of high skill level is 11%. If we disregard the mediation effect through occupation, would gender negatively affect salary?",
