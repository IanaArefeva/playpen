Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that waking up late and heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is no traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if waking up on time instead of waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The only direct effects we have are: (1) Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school, and (2) traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The condition that \"waking up late and heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time\" does not imply that \"waking up on time and no traffic cause arriving to school on time\". In other words, we do not have a direct link between \"waking up on time\" and \"arriving to school on time\" in the absence of \"heavy traffic\".<|eot_id|>",
