The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that waking up late and heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is no traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if waking up on time instead of waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The condition that \"waking up late and heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time\" does not imply that \"waking up on time and no traffic cause arriving to school on time\".
