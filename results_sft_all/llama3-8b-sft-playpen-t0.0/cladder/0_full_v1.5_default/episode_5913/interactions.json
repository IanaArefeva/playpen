The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and freckles. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on freckles. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of clean water is 35%. The probability of polluted water and freckles is 40%. The probability of clean water and freckles is 29%. Is the chance of freckles larger when observing clean water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of clean water is 35% and the probability of clean water and freckles is 29%, the probability of bad water quality is 65%. This higher probability of bad water quality when freckles are present than when clean water is present (35%) suggests that the chance of freckles is larger when water quality is bad, not when clean water is present.||",
