The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of speaking english is 97%. The probability of not speaking english and the forest on fire is 3%. The probability of speaking english and the forest on fire is 61%. Is the chance of the forest on fire smaller when observing speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
