Having a brother has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and do not have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 89%. For people with no pre-conditions and have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 79%. For people with pre-conditions and do not have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 22%. For people with pre-conditions and have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 15%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 54%. For people who have a brother, would it be more likely to see recovering from the disease if the person did not have a brother?",
