Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 19%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and high infant mortality is 37%. The probability of smoking mother and high infant mortality is 16%. Is the chance of high infant mortality larger when observing smoking mother?",
