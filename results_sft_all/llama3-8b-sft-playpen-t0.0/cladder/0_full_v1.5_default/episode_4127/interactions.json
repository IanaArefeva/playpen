The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 90%. The probability of absence of citrus and curly hair is 7%. The probability of citrus intake and curly hair is 30%. Is the chance of curly hair larger when observing citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 30% of the time, citrus is consumed and curly hair is present, and 60% of the time, citrus is consumed but curly hair is not present. In other words, the probability of curly hair given citrus is 30/90 = 1/3, and the probability of curly hair given no citrus is 1/9 (since the probability of no citrus is 10% and the probability of no citrus and curly hair is 7%). Since 1/3 is larger than 1/9, the chance of curly hair is larger when not observing citrus intake.||",
