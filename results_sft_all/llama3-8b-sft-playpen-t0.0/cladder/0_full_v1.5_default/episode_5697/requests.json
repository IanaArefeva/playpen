The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 87%. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 54%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 31%. Is high infant mortality less likely than low infant mortality overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of having a sister is 87%, this means that the majority of infants (87%) have a lower risk of high infant mortality compared to those without a sister (13%). This indicates that high infant mortality is less likely than low infant mortality overall, as the higher probability of having a sister (and its associated lower risk of high infant mortality) outweighs the lower probability of not having a sister (and its associated higher risk of high infant mortality).<|eot_id|>",
