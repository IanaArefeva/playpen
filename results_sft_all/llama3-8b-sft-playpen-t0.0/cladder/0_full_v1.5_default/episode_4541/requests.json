The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and brown eyes. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on brown eyes. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 17%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of brown eyes is 60%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of brown eyes is 30%. Is brown eyes less likely than blue eyes overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is because the subpopulation of children with smoking mothers is a separate, distinct subpopulation that does not directly influence the overall probability of brown eyes in the entire population. The direct relationship between maternal smoking status and brown eyes does not imply that brown eyes are less likely than blue eyes overall, as the overall probability of brown eyes remains the same as the probability in the subpopulation of children with nonsmoking mothers.<|eot_id|>",
