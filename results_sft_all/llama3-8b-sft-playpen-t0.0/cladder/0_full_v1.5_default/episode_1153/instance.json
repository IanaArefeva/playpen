Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 9%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 32%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 75%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 98%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 54%. For people getting the vaccine, would it be more likely to see recovering from the disease if the person had not refused the vaccine?",
