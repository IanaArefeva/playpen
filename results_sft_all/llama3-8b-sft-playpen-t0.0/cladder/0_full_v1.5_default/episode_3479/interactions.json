The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 7%. The probability of no tanning salon treatment and large feet is 26%. The probability of tanning salon treatment and large feet is 5%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of tanning salon treatment on foot size is positive, meaning that tanning salon treatment is associated with larger foot size. The probability of large feet is 5% when we condition on tanning salon treatment, which is higher than the overall probability of large feet (26%). This suggests that tanning salon treatment is associated with larger foot size, and the chance of large feet is not smaller when we condition on tanning salon treatment.||",
