  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and rainfall. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 60%. The probability of reduced supply and high rainfall is 25%. The probability of increased supply and high rainfall is 24%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing increased supply?",
