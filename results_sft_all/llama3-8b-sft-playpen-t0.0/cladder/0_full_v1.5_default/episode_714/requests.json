Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 53%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 35%. Will male gender decrease the chance of admission acceptance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that male gender is associated with a lower chance of admission acceptance.<|eot_id|>",
