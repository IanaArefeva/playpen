The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. We know that smoking mother or good health causes normal infant birth weight. smoking mother or good health or normal infant birth weight causes high infant mortality. We observed the person has poor health. Would infant mortality is low if nonsmoking mother instead of smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A smoking mother still has a direct effect on birth weight and, through that, on infant mortality. Since the person already has poor health, the additional effect of a smoking mother on birth weight and subsequent infant mortality is not necessary to conclude that the person's infant will have high mortality. The direct effect of the person's health condition on both birth weight and infant mortality is already sufficient to conclude that the person's infant will have high mortality, independent of the mother's smoking status.<|eot_id|>",
