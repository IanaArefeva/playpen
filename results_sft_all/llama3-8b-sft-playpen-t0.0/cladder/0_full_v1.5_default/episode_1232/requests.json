The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 62%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 93%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 96%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 25%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 70%. The overall probability of smoking is 51%. Does smoking negatively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is positive (70% probability of lung cancer for smokers with high tar deposit), and the direct effect of tar deposit on lung cancer is also positive (96% probability of lung cancer for nonsmokers with high tar deposit). The negative relationship between smoking and lung cancer through the intermediate variable of tar deposit is not supported by the given data, as the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers in both the high and no tar deposit scenarios.<|eot_id|>",
