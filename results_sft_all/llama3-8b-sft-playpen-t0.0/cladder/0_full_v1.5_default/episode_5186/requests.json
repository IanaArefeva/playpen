The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 80%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 51%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 47%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 20%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 72%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 22%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would encouragement level negatively affect brown eyes?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This positive direct relationship supersedes any potential negative effect that might be introduced by the studying habits of the students.<|eot_id|>",
