Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. For hospitalized individuals, the correlation between respiratory issues and broken bones is -0.02. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does it mean that respiratory issues does not affect broken bones?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The negative correlation could be due to the fact that hospitalization status is a common cause for both respiratory issues and broken bones, and this common cause (hospitalization) exerts opposite effects on the two variables (respiratory issues and broken bones), leading to a negative correlation between them.<|eot_id|>",
