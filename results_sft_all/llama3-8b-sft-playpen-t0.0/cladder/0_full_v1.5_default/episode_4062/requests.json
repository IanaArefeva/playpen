Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 59%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 59%.

The probability of long lifespan is the same for both English speakers and non-English speakers (59%). The direct effect of diabetes on lifespan is also not clear, as the relationship between diabetes and lifespan is not quantified. The direct effect of smoking on diabetes and lifespan is also not quantified. The only quantified relationship is the direct effect of diabetes on lifespan, which is not necessary to answer the question. The key point is that the probability of long lifespan is the same for both English speakers and non-English speakers, which suggests that speaking English does not increase the chance of long lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
