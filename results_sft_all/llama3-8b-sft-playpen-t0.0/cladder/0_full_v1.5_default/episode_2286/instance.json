For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 50%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 80%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 36%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 17%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 74%.
