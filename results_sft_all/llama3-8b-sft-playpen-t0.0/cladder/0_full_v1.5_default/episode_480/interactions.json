The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 78%. For people not taking any medication and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 30%. For people taking medication and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 73%. For people taking medication and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 41%. For people not taking any medication, the probability of high blood pressure is 65%. For people taking medication, the probability of high blood pressure is 29%. Does medication negatively affect heart condition through blood pressure?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a healthy heart among those taking medication and with high blood pressure (41%) is higher than the probability of a healthy heart among those not taking medication and with high blood pressure (30%). This suggests that medication has a positive effect on heart condition, independent of its effect on blood pressure.||",
