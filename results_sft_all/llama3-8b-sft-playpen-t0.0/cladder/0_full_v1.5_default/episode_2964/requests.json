Since male gender and high skill level cause white-collar job, and white-collar job and male gender cause high salary, we can conclude that the person is likely to have a white-collar job and a high salary, given their high skill level. The direct effect of male gender on occupation and salary is already accounted for by the person's high skill level, which supersedes the effect of male gender. Therefore, the person is not likely to have a low salary if male gender instead of non-male gender.<|eot_id|>",
