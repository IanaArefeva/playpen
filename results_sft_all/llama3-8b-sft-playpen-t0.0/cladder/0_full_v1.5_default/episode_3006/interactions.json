The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. We know that increased demand and increased yield per acre causes increased supply. increased demand and increased supply causes increased price. We observed the farm has an increased yield per acre and the demand is low. Would there is an increased price if increased supply instead of reduced supply?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
