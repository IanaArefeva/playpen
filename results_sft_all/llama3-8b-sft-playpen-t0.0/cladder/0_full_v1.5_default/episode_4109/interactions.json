The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 89%. The probability of absence of citrus and curly hair is 6%. The probability of citrus intake and curly hair is 20%. Is the chance of curly hair smaller when observing citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
