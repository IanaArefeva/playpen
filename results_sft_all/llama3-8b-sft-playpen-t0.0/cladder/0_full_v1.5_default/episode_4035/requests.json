Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 79%. For smokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 48%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see being lactose intolerant if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between effort and being lactose intolerant is that higher effort is associated with a lower probability of being lactose intolerant. Since the student is a smoker, we already know that they have a lower probability of being lactose intolerant (48%). If we consider the additional condition that the student would have been a nonsmoker, we would still be looking at a higher probability of being lactose intolerant (79%). The direct relationship between being a smoker and being a nonsmoker is that being a smoker is associated with lower probability of being lactose intolerant. In this case, the student is already a smoker, so the condition of being a nonsmoker does not change the probability of being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
