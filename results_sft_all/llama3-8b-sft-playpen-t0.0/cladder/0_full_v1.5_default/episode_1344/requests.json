The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 24%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 17%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 16%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 12%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 45%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 67%. The overall probability of high pollution is 53%. Does gene negatively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The gene affects the likelihood of smoking, which in turn affects the likelihood of lung cancer. The direct relationship between the gene and lung cancer is not negative; in fact, the probability of lung cancer is higher for those with the smoking gene than for those without it, both in the case of smokers and in the case of nonsmokers.<|eot_id|>",
