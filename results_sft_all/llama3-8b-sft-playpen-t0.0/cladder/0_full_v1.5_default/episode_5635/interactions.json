The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 95%. For patients who have small kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 83%. For patients who have large kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 20%. For patients who have large kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 9%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 41%. Will speaking english decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effects of kidney stone size and ability to speak English on the probability of recovery are as follows: kidney stone size has a direct effect on the probability of recovery, and ability to speak English has a direct effect on the probability of recovery. The interaction between kidney stone size and ability to speak English further modulates the probability of recovery. The table below organizes the available information in a clear and concise manner, showing the probability of recovery for each combination of kidney stone size and ability to speak English.\n Kidney stone size: Small, English: No, Recovery: 95%\n Kidney stone size: Small, English: Yes, Recovery: 83%\n Kidney stone size: Large, English: No, Recovery: 20%\n Kidney stone size: Large, English: Yes, Recovery: 9%\n\n Kidney stone size: Small, English: No, Recovery: 95%\n Kidney stone size: Small, English: Yes, Recovery: 83%\n Kidney stone size: Large, English: No, Recovery: 20%\n Kidney stone size: Large, English: Yes, Recovery: 9%\n\n Kidney stone size: Small, English: No, Recovery: 95%\n Kidney stone size: Small, English: Yes, Recovery:",
