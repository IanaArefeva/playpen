Additionally, the direct relationship between department competitiveness and higher probability of admission acceptance further solidifies this positive relationship. Since the probability of male gender is 41%, this means that a large fraction of the population is male, which in turn means that a large fraction of the population is likely to have higher probability of admission acceptance. This could lead to an overall higher probability of admission acceptance than rejection, but we need to carefully consider the joint effects of these relationships. If we condition on male gender, we see that the probability of admission acceptance is 48%, which is higher than the 28% for non-male. This already suggests that male gender is a positive predictor of admission acceptance. Now, if we condition on the event that the person is male, we can further condition on the event that the person is in a more competitive department. In this case, the probability of admission acceptance is higher than the 48% we saw for male gender in general. This further solidifies the positive relationship between male gender and higher probability of admission acceptance. Finally, we need to consider the joint effects of male gender and department competitiveness on the probability of admission acceptance. If we condition on the event that the person is male and in a more competitive department, we see that the probability of admission acceptance is higher than the ",
