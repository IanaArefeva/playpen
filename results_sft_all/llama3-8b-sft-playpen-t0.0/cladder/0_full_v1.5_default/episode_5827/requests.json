Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 70%. For people who have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 53%.

The probability of lung cancer is lower for people who have a brother (53%) compared to those who do not have a brother (70%). This suggests that having a brother might actually reduce the chance of lung cancer, rather than increase it.<|eot_id|>",
