The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 36%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 77%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 51%. Is cholera contraction more likely than cholera prevention overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the overall probability of liking spicy food is 36%, we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of cholera contraction. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event E is the sum of the products of the probability of E given each possible cause C and the probability of C. In this case, the event E is cholera contraction, and the two possible causes C are \"like spicy food\" and \"not like spicy food\". The probability of E given C is the probability of E in the subpopulation where C is true. The probability of C is the probability of C in the entire population. The law of total probability can be formalized as follows: P(E) = P(E|C1)P(C1) + P(E|C2)P(C2), where E is the event of interest, C1 and C2 are the two possible causes, and P(E|C) is the probability of E given C. In this case, E is the event of cholera contraction, C1 is the event of \"like spicy food\", and C2 is the event of \"not like spicy food\". The probability of E given C1 is 51%, the probability of E given C2 is 77%, the probability of C1 is 36",
