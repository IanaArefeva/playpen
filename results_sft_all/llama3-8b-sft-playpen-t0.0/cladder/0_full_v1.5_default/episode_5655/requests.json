The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of speaking english is 45%. For patients who do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 35%. For patients who speak english, the probability of recovery is 78%. Is recovery less likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of speaking English is 45%, and the probability of recovery is higher for those who speak English (78%) than for those who do not (35%), we can conclude that the overall probability of recovery is higher than the probability of non-recovery.<|eot_id|>",
