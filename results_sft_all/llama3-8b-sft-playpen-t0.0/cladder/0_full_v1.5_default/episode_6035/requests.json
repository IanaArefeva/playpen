Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. We know that having a brother causes having smallpox and no vaccine reaction. having smallpox or severe vaccination reaction causes smallpox survival. Would the person dies from smallpox if having a brother instead of not having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of having a brother is that it causes having smallpox and no vaccine reaction. Since having smallpox or a severe vaccine reaction is what leads to smallpox survival, and the person in this case has no vaccine reaction, the person would not die from smallpox.<|eot_id|>",
