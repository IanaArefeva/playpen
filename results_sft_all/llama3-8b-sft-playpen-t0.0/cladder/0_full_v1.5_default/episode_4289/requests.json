The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 3%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 26%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 70%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 92%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 42%. For people getting the vaccine, would it be less likely to see being lactose intolerant if the person had not refused the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the vaccine has a positive effect on the risk of being lactose intolerant, and this effect is not offset by the person's willingness to get the vaccine.<|eot_id|>",
