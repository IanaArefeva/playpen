The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 22%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 62%. Will having visited England decrease the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of high salary is higher for those who have visited England (62%) than for those who have not (22%). This suggests that having visited England has a positive effect on salary, which in turn could lead to higher occupation levels. Since occupation has a direct effect on salary, the positive effect of having visited England on occupation could further increase the probability of high salary.||",
