The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 24%. For people without a college degree, the probability of large feet is 85%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of large feet is 48%. Is large feet less likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional information that people with a college degree or higher have a 48% chance of large feet, while those without a college degree have an 85% chance of large feet, further solidifies this conclusion. The unobserved confounders' direct effects on both education level and foot size do not change the overall likelihood of large feet compared to small feet, as their effects are balanced across both groups.||",
