The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 81%. The probability of not liking spicy food and cholera contraction is 13%. The probability of liking spicy food and cholera contraction is 17%. Is the chance of cholera contraction larger when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of not liking spicy food and cholera contraction is 13%, which is higher than the probability of liking spicy food and cholera contraction (17%). This suggests that the chance of cholera contraction is larger when not observing liking spicy food.<|eot_id|>",
