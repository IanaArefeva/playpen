Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of having a brother is 87%. The probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival is 6%. The probability of having a brother and smallpox survival is 43%. Is the chance of smallpox survival larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of having a brother and smallpox survival is 43%, which is lower than the probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival (6%).\n2. The probability of having a brother is 87%, which is higher than the probability of not having a brother (13%).\n3. The direct effect of having a brother on smallpox survival is not clear from the given information. The direct effect of having a brother on smallpox survival is not isolated from the direct effect of having a brother on vaccination reaction and the direct effect of vaccination reaction on smallpox survival.\n4.
