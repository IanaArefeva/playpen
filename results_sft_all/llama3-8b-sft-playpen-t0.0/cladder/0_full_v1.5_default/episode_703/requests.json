The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 63%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 21%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 50%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 90%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 37%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 32%. Does gender positively affect admission status through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key insight here is that the effect of being male on admission status is entirely accounted for by the higher probability of being in a competitive department, which in turn leads to a higher probability of admission acceptance. In other words, the positive effect of being male on admission status is entirely due to the higher likelihood of being in a competitive department, rather than any direct effect of being male on its own.<|eot_id|>",
