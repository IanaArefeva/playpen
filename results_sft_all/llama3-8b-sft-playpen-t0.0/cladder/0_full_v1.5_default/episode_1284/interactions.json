The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 44%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 79%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 20%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 35%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. The overall probability of smoking is 59%. Does smoking positively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is not fully captured by the given probabilities, as the relationship is more complex than a direct cause-and-effect chain. The probability of lung cancer among smokers is higher than among nonsmokers, but this difference can be attributed to the higher probability of high tar deposit among smokers, which in turn increases the likelihood of lung cancer. The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is not isolated from the intervening role of tar deposit, and the given probabilities do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that smoking directly affects lung cancer through any mechanism other than the one involving tar deposit.||",
