  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how maternal smoking status correlates with infant's birth weight case by case according to unobserved confounders. Method 2: We look directly at how maternal smoking status correlates with infant's birth weight in general. To understand how maternal smoking status affects infant's birth weight, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?",
