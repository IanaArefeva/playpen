The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 34%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 73%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 44%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 83%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 11%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effects of the CEO and the manager on the probability of the employee being fired are not the focus here; rather, we need to examine the interaction between the manager's action (signing the termination letter) and the CEO's decision to fire the employee. The table below organizes the different scenarios and their associated probabilities of the employee being fired:\n\n| CEO's decision to fire the employee (P) | Manager's action (Q) | P(Q) (probability of Q given P) | P(employee fired) (P(employee fired) given Q and P) |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Yes (P)                                  | Yes (Q)             | 1 (Q is always yes when P is yes)        | 83% (P(employee fired) given Q and P)          |\n| Yes (P)                                  | No (Q)              | 0 (Q is always no when P is yes)         | 34% (P(employee fired) given Q and P)          |\n| No (P)                                   | Yes (Q)             | 1 (Q is always yes when P is no)        | 0%  (P(employee fired) given Q and P)          |\n| No (P)                                   | No (Q)              | 1 (Q is",
