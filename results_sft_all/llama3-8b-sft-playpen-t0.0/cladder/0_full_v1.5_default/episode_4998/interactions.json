The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of having a sister is 9%. The probability of not having a sister and healthy heart is 52%. The probability of having a sister and healthy heart is 3%. Is the chance of healthy heart larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The interaction between having a sister and blood pressure also needs to be considered. Since having a sister has a direct effect on both blood pressure and heart condition, we must examine the joint probability of having a sister and a heart condition to fully understand the relationship. The probability of having a sister and a heart condition is 3%, and the probability of not having a sister and a heart condition is 52%. This means that the probability of having a heart condition is higher when not having a sister (52%) than when having a sister (3%). This counterintuitive finding suggests that the chance of a heart condition is larger when not observing having a sister, rather than when having a sister.||",
