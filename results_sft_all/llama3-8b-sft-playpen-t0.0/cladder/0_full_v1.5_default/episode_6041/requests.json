The direct relationship between having a sister and blood pressure is that having a sister leads to high blood pressure. The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is that high blood pressure leads to a heart condition. If we consider the chain of cause and effect, we see that having a sister leads to high blood pressure, which in turn leads to a heart condition. Since having a sister is associated with a heart condition, we conclude that having a sister does not lead to a healthy heart.<|eot_id|>",
