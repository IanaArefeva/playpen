Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 84%. The probability of absence of citrus and scurvy is 10%. The probability of citrus intake and scurvy is 36%. Is the chance of scurvy larger when observing citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the probability of scurvy given citrus intake is 36% / 84% = 0.4286, which is less than the probability of scurvy in the absence of citrus (10% / (1 - 84%) = 0.5556).<|eot_id|>",
