For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 62%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 87%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 56%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 86%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 45%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 85%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 46%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 95%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect admission status?",
