The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of brown eyes is 58%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of brown eyes is 34%. For students who are encouraged, would it be more likely to see brown eyes if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between studying habits and brown eyes is that studying habits lead to a higher probability of brown eyes. Since encouragement directly affects brown eyes and studying habits, and studying habits lead to a higher probability of brown eyes, it's likely that encouragement would lead to a lower probability of brown eyes, not a higher one.<|eot_id|>",
