Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of vaccination is 100%. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 58%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 48%. Is smallpox survival less likely than smallpox death overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This does not imply that smallpox survival is less likely than smallpox death overall. In fact, the opposite is true: the probability of smallpox death is lower for both unvaccinated (42%) and vaccinated (52%) groups than for the general population, which we can infer is around 50% (since the probability of smallpox death is 50% for the unvaccinated and 52% for the vaccinated, and the probability of smallpox survival is 58% for the unvaccinated and 48% for the vaccinated).<|eot_id|>",
