For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 73%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 22%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 0%. The overall probability of old age is 52%.
