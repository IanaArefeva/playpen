Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives no treatment. large kidney stone and receives treatment causes recovery. We observed the patient has a small kidney stone.

Since the patient has a small kidney stone, we can conclude that the patient would not have large kidney stone and, by extension, would not have the condition that typically leads to no treatment. In this case, the patient's small kidney stone size does not directly lead to no treatment, so we need to consider the relationship between small kidney stone and treatment. The direct relationship is that small kidney stone and no treatment cause no recovery, and small kidney stone and treatment cause recovery. Since the patient has a small kidney stone and we are considering the case where the patient receives treatment, we can conclude that the patient would recover.<|eot_id|>",
