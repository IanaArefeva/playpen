The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 81%. The probability of not having a brother and high salary is 8%. The probability of having a brother and high salary is 59%. Is the chance of high salary smaller when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
