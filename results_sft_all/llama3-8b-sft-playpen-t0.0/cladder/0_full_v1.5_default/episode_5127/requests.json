The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 81%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 60%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 66%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The given probabilities of high salary for those with and without a brother (66% and 60%, respectively) already account for the intervening variable of skill. Since the probability of having a brother is 81%, the overall probability of high salary is a weighted average of the two scenarios: (0.81 * 0.66) + (0.19 * 0.60) = 0.6489 + 0.114 = 0.7629, which is higher than the probability of having a high salary when not having a brother (0.60). This suggests that having a brother is associated with a higher likelihood of having a high salary, rather than a lower likelihood.<|eot_id|>",
