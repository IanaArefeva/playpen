Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 72%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 84%. For individuals who are male, would it be less likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that being male directly leads to a higher probability of admission acceptance. The counterfactual question is whether it would be less likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male. Since the direct effect of being male is an increase in the probability of admission acceptance, it would not be less likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male.<|eot_id|>",
