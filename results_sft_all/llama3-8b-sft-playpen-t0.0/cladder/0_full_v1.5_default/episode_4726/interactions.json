The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For people who have not visited England, the probability of the prisoner's death is 32%. For people who have visited England, the probability of the prisoner's death is 75%. For people who have visited England, would it be more likely to see the prisoner's death if the person had not visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of the corporal on the probability of the prisoner's death is 0% since the corporal's state is not directly related to the probability of the prisoner's death. The direct effect of the private on the probability of the prisoner's death is also 0% for the same reason. Since the direct effect of having visited England on the probability of the prisoner's death is positive (43%), and the direct effects of the corporal and the private on the probability of the prisoner's death are both 0%, it is not more likely to see the prisoner's death if the person had not visited England.||",
