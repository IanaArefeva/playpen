The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how parents' intelligence correlates with child's intelligence in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to parents' social status. To understand how parents' intelligence affects child's intelligence, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If we look at the general correlation between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence (Method 1), we will likely overestimate the direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence, as we are not controlling for the confounding effect of parents' social status. In contrast, looking at the correlation case by case according to parents' social status (Method 2) can help us control for this confounding variable and provide a more accurate estimate of the direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
