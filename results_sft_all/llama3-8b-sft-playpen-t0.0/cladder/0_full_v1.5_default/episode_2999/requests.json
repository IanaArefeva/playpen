Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes sufficient vitamin C, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes scurvy.

Since citrus directly affects vitamin C, and vitamin C directly affects scurvy, we can conclude that citrus is a cause of scurvy. If citrus is present, it will lead to an increase in vitamin C, which in turn will lead to a reduction in scurvy. If citrus is absent, it will lead to a reduction in vitamin C, which in turn will lead to an increase in scurvy. Therefore, the absence of citrus is a cause of scurvy, and citrus is a cause of the absence of scurvy.<|eot_id|>",
