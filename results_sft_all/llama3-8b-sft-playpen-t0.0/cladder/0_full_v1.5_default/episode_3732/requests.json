The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drinking coffee and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 22%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 42%. For people living far from a college, the probability of drinking coffee is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of drinking coffee is 78%. Will drinking coffee increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both coffee consumption and salary, which means that the relationship between coffee consumption and salary is likely being influenced by an unobserved variable. This confounding variable could be skewing the apparent relationship between coffee consumption and salary, leading to a spurious positive association. In other words, the observed positive relationship between coffee consumption and salary might be entirely due to the unobserved confounders rather than any direct causal link between the two.<|eot_id|>",
