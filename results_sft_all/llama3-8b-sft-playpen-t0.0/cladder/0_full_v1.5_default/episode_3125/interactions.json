The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active or high cigarette tax causes smoking mother. confounder active and smoking mother causes normal infant birth weight. We observed the cigarette tax is high and confounder active. Would the infant is born with a normal weight if smoking mother instead of nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we know that the unobserved confounder is active and that it has a direct effect on both the maternal smoking status and the infant's birth weight, we must consider its potential impact on the birth weight. The active unobserved confounder likely exerts a positive effect on the birth weight, which is not offset by the negative effect of the maternal smoking status. This means that the birth weight is likely to be normal, not just because of the direct effect of the maternal smoking status, but also because of the active unobserved confounder.||",
