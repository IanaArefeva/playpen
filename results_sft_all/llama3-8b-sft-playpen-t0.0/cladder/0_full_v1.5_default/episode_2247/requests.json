The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 7%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 79%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 3%. Is the chance of intelligent child smaller when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 3%, which directly shows that there is a positive relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence. The additional unobserved factor that affects both parents' social status and child's intelligence does not change this direct relationship. The probability of intelligent child given intelligent parents is still higher than the probability of intelligent child given unintelligent parents, which is 3% compared to 1.4% (79% of 1.4% is 1.096%, and 3% is higher than 1.096%).<|eot_id|>",
