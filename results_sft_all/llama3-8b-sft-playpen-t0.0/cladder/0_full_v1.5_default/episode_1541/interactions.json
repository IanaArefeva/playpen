The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 73%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 31%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 90%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 47%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 91%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The manager's action of signing the termination letter does not directly affect the probability of the employee being fired. The probability of the employee being fired is determined by the CEO's decision and the manager's action, but the manager's action does not conditionally change the probability of the employee being fired based on the CEO's decision. The manager's action is more of a confirmatory action rather than a causal one in this context.||",
