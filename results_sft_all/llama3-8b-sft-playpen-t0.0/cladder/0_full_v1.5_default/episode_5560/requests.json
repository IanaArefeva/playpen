Treatment has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of receives treatment is 59%. The probability of receives no treatment and being allergic to peanuts is 10%. The probability of receives treatment and being allergic to peanuts is 38%. Is the chance of being allergic to peanuts smaller when observing receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that if an individual is given the treatment, their likelihood of being allergic to peanuts is higher than if they are not given the treatment. The probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher in the treatment group than in the control group, which is a direct result of the treatment's positive effect on the probability of being allergic to peanuts.<|eot_id|>",
