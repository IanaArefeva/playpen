Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 45%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, it might appear that smoking directly affects the risk of lung cancer. However, the correct interpretation is that the higher risk of lung cancer among smokers is a result of the higher tar deposit associated with smoking, not a direct effect of smoking on lung cancer. In this world, the direct relationship is between tar deposit and lung cancer, not between smoking and lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
