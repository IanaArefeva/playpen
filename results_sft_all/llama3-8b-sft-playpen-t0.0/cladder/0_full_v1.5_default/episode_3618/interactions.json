The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 66%. For people who do not have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 9%. For people who have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 91%. For people who have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 25%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 47%. For people who have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 19%. Does having a sister negatively affect heart condition through blood pressure?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a healthy heart for those with a sister and high blood pressure is 25%, which is lower than the 66% probability for those without a sister and with high blood pressure. This suggests that having a sister has a direct negative effect on heart condition that is not fully accounted for by blood pressure.||",
