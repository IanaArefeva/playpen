The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 62%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 28%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 27%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 97%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 45%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of high tar deposit is higher than the probability of no tar deposit (45%  55%), we can conclude that the person is more likely to have high tar deposit than no tar deposit. Given that the probability of lung cancer is lower with high tar deposit (27%) than with no tar deposit (61%), we can conclude that the person is more likely to have lung cancer if they have no tar deposit than if they have high tar deposit.||",
