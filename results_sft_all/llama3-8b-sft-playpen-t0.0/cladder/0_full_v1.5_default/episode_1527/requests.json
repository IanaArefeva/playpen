The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 52%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 20%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 77%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 47%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 91%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the manager's action of not signing the termination letter is associated with a higher probability of the employee being fired, rather than the opposite.<|eot_id|>",
