Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of encouragement is 91%. The probability of discouragement and high exam score is 5%. The probability of encouragement and high exam score is 41%.

This means that the probability of high exam score given encouragement is 41/91, which is less than the probability of high exam score (5%) since 5% is less than 41%.<|eot_id|>",
