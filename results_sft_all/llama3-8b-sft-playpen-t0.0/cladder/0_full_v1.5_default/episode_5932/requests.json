The candle has a direct effect on room. We know that liking spicy food or candle with wax causes dark room. We observed the candle is out of wax. Would the room is bright if liking spicy food instead of not liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
