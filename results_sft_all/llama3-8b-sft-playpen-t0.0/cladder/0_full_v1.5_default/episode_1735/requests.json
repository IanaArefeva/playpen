The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 12%. The probability of waking up on time and arriving to school on time is 37%. The probability of waking up late and arriving to school on time is 9%. Is the chance of arriving to school on time larger when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of both waking up late and arriving to school on time is 9%. Since the probability of both events (waking up late and arriving on time) is lower than the probability of just arriving on time (37% vs 9%), it's clear that the chance of arriving to school on time is not larger when observing waking up late.<|eot_id|>",
