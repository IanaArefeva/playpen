The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 75%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 35%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 74%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 36%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 85%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 11%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see freckles if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high tar deposit for a smoker is 11%. Since the probability of high tar deposit is lower than the probability of no tar deposit, the overall probability of freckles for a smoker is more likely to be close to the higher value (74%) than the lower value (36%).<|eot_id|>",
