The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 63%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 80%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 34%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 56%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 78%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 100%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 42%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 70%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 20%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between department competitiveness and freckles is also a direct one, and this relationship can mediate the relationship between gender and freckles. In particular, the probability of freckles is higher for those in competitive departments than for those in non-competitive departments, and this difference in probability is not fully accounted for by the direct relationship between gender and freckles. In other words, the relationship between department competitiveness and freckles can \"explain away\" some of the apparent relationship between gender and freckles, leading to a net negative effect of gender on freckles when this mediation is taken into account.||",
