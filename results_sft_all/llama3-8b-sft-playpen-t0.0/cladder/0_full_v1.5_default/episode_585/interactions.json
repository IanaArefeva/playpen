The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 2%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 65%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 84%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of not having a college degree is 98%, and for this group, the probability of high salary is 65%. To find the overall probability of high salary, we need to consider both groups. The overall probability of high salary is the sum of the products of the probability of each group and the probability of high salary in that group: (0.02 * 0.84) + (0.98 * 0.65) = 0.0168 + 0.6354 = 0.6522. The probability of low salary is 1 - 0.6522 = 0.3478. Since 0.6522 is less than 0.5, we conclude that high salary is less likely than low salary overall.||",
