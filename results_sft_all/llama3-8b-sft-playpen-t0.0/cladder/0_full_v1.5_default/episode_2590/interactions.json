The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 77%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 26%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 45%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 63%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 37%. The overall probability of smoking is 39%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than that among nonsmokers in both the no tar and high tar scenarios. This counterintuitive finding can be explained by the intervening variable of tar deposit. The higher probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with high tar deposit compared to those with no tar deposit suggests that the presence of tar is a more significant risk factor than smoking itself. In the absence of direct information about the individual's gender, we must consider the joint effects of smoking and tar deposit on lung cancer. The lower probability of lung cancer among smokers with high tar deposit compared to those with no tar deposit further supports this conclusion.||",
