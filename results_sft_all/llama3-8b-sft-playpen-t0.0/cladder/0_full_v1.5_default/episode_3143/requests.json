The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 17%. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 64%. For people who drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 51%. For people who drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 98%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 72%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 27%. Does drinking coffee negatively affect alarm clock through wife?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is higher when the wife sets the alarm, and this behavior is more likely when the person drinks coffee. This suggests that the direct effect of coffee consumption on the alarm clock is positive, rather than negative.<|eot_id|>",
