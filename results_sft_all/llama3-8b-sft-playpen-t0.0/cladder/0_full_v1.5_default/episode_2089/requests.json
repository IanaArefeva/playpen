Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 67%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 22%. Will male gender decrease the chance of admission acceptance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of male gender on department competitiveness is not quantified, but it is likely that male gender would increase department competitiveness, which in turn would increase the chance of admission acceptance. Since the direct effect of male gender on admission acceptance is positive, male gender would not decrease the chance of admission acceptance.<|eot_id|>",
