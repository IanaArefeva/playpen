The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 32%. For children who like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 80%. For children who like spicy food, would it be less likely to see intelligent child if the child did not like spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of intelligent child is higher for children who like spicy food (80%) than for children who do not like spicy food (32%). This difference in probability is not directly related to the parents' social status, which is also a separate factor. The parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence, but this does not change the fact that children who like spicy food are more likely to be intelligent than those who do not like spicy food.<|eot_id|>",
