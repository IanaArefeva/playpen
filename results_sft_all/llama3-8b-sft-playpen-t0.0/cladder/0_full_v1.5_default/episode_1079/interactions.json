The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 8%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 26%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 84%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 99%. The overall probability of male gender is 53%. Will receives treatment decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that not receiving treatment is associated with a higher chance of recovery for male patients. Since the probability of male gender is 53%, we can conclude that the overall probability of recovery is higher for male patients than for female patients. The probability of recovery for female patients who are not male and not receiving treatment is 8%, which is lower than the probability of recovery for female patients who are not male and receiving treatment (26%). This further supports the idea that not receiving treatment is associated with a lower chance of recovery for female patients. Since the probability of male gender is 53%, we can conclude that the overall probability of recovery is higher for male patients than for female patients.||",
