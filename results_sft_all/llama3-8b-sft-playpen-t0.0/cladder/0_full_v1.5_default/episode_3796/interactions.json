The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who cannot swim and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 25%. For students who cannot swim and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 50%. For students who can swim and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 49%. For students who can swim and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 77%. For students who cannot swim, the probability of studying hard is 24%. For students who can swim, the probability of studying hard is 72%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would ability to swim positively affect exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the case of students who can swim and study hard, the exam score is higher than in the case of students who can swim but do not study hard. This suggests that the positive relationship between ability to swim and exam score is likely due to the intervening variable of studying habits rather than a direct effect.||",
