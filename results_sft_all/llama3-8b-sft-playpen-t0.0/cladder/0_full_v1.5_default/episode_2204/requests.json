The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Respiratory issues has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of respiratory issues is 44%. For people with no respiratory issues and non-hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 92%. For people with no respiratory issues and hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 84%. For people with respiratory issues and non-hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 92%. For people with respiratory issues and hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 57%. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does the chance of broken bones decrease when respiratory issues?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the chance of broken bones does not decrease when respiratory issues are present among hospitalized individuals.<|eot_id|>",
