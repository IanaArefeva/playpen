Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of vaccination is 76%. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 33%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 34%. Is smallpox survival more likely than smallpox death overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between smallpox and smallpox survival is that the probability of smallpox survival is higher for those who get smallpox (34%) than for those who do not get smallpox (33%). The direct relationship between vaccination reaction and smallpox survival is that the probability of smallpox survival is higher for those who have a positive vaccination reaction (34%) than for those who have a negative vaccination reaction (33%). The direct relationship between smallpox and smallpox death is that the probability of smallpox death is higher for those who get smallpox (66%) than for those who do not get smallpox (67%). The direct relationship between vaccination and smallpox death is that the probability of smallpox death is higher for unvaccinated (67%) than for vaccinated (66%) individuals. The direct relationship between vaccination reaction and smallpox death is that the probability of smallpox death is higher for those who have a negative vaccination reaction (67%) than for those who have a positive vaccination reaction (66%).<|eot_id|>",
