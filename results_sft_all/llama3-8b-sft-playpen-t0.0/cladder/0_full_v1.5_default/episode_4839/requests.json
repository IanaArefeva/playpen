The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of speaking english is 93%. The probability of not speaking english and the forest on fire is 5%. The probability of speaking english and the forest on fire is 61%. Is the chance of the forest on fire larger when observing speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
