Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 77%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 45%.

The only direct relationship we have is that diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. The probability of long lifespan is higher for those who do not speak English (77%) than for those who speak English (45%). This suggests that not speaking English might be associated with a lower risk of diabetes, which in turn could lead to a higher probability of long lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
