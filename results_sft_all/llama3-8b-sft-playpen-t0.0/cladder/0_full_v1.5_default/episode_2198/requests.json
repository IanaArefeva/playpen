Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. For hospitalized individuals, the correlation between respiratory issues and broken bones is 0.10. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does it mean that respiratory issues affects broken bones?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The hospitalization status is a common cause for both, and the observed correlation of 0.10 between respiratory issues and broken bones among hospitalized individuals is likely due to the hospitalization status being the primary driver of this association rather than a direct causal link between the two health conditions.<|eot_id|>",
