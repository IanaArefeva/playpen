For individuals who are male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 45%. For individuals who are male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 84%. For individuals who are not male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 9%. For individuals who are not male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 48%. For individuals who are male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 62%. For individuals who are male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 88%. The overall probability of high skill level is 7%.
