The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England and director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to fire the employee. Would the employee is not fired if not having visited England instead of having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key link is through the director's action, which is a direct result of the CEO's decision.\n2. The relationship between the CEO and the director is a direct cause of the director's action, which in turn directly affects the employee's fate.\n3. The condition \"not having visited England\" does not directly counteract the CEO's decision to fire the employee. The primary cause of the employee's firing is still the CEO's decision, which is not directly counteracted by the absence of having visited England.\n4. The chain of causality is as follows: CEO (firing the employee) - director (signing the termination letter) - employee (being fired). The absence of having visited England does not disrupt this chain, as the primary cause of the employee's firing remains the CEO's decision.\n5. The condition \"not having visited England\" might imply a different chain of causality, but in this specific world, the direct relationship between the CEO and the director is the primary cause of the employee's firing, and the absence of having visited England does not directly counteract this relationship.||",
