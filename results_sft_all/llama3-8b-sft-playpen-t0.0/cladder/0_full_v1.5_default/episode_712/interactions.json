The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 70%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 67%. Will male gender decrease the chance of admission acceptance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of male gender on department competitiveness is not quantified, and the direct effect of department competitiveness on admission acceptance is a 3% increase (70% - 67%). Since the direct effect of male gender on admission acceptance is a 2% decrease, and the direct effect of male gender on department competitiveness is not quantified, we need to consider the interaction between these two effects. If male gender leads to higher department competitiveness, then the positive effect of higher competitiveness on admission acceptance could offset the negative direct effect of male gender on admission acceptance. In this case, male gender might not decrease the chance of admission acceptance.||",
