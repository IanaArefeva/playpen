Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 92%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 79%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 27%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 14%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 58%. For people getting the vaccine, would it be less likely to see recovering from the disease if the person had not refused the vaccine?",
