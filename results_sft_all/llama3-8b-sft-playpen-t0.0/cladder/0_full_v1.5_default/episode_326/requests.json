Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 25%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 77%.

The probability of tanned skin is also directly affected by the action of \"going to the beach\". In the absence of tanning salon treatment, the probability of tanned skin is 25%, which is higher than the 0% probability associated with not going to the beach. This suggests that \"going to the beach\" is a more significant factor in determining tanned skin than \"tanning salon treatment\". Since the probability of tanned skin is higher for people not using tanning salon treatments than for those who do, it can be concluded that tanning salon treatment does not increase the chance of tanned skin.<|eot_id|>",
