The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on skin. Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 25%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 77%. Will tanning salon treatment increase the chance of tanned skin?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of tanned skin is also directly affected by the action of \"going to the beach\". In the absence of tanning salon treatment, the probability of tanned skin is 25%, which is higher than the 0% probability associated with not going to the beach. This suggests that \"going to the beach\" is a more significant factor in determining tanned skin than \"tanning salon treatment\". Since the probability of tanned skin is higher for people not using tanning salon treatments than for those who do, it can be concluded that tanning salon treatment does not increase the chance of tanned skin.||",
