Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 31%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 95%.

This means that tanning salon treatment directly causes a higher probability of tanned skin, which is the defining condition for a cause-and-effect relationship in this context.<|eot_id|>",
