The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 57%. The probability of low hospital bill and recovery is 25%. The probability of high hospital bill and recovery is 20%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing high hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of high hospital bill is 57%, and the probability of high hospital bill and recovery is 20%. This does not imply that the chance of recovery is larger when observing a high hospital bill. In fact, the probability of high hospital bill and recovery is lower than the probability of high hospital bill (57%) and the probability of recovery in the absence of a high hospital bill (25% is the probability of both a low hospital bill and a positive recovery, and we do not have direct information on the probability of a positive recovery in the absence of a high hospital bill, but we can conclude that the probability of a positive recovery in the absence of a high hospital bill is higher than 20% since the probability of a positive recovery is higher than 25% and the probability of a high hospital bill is 57%).||",
