Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 48%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of high salary is 37%. For individuals who are male, the probability of high salary is 73%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Additionally, the lower probability of high salary among non-male individuals (37%) further supports this conclusion. The direct relationship between occupation and salary also suggests that occupation is a key driver of salary, which could be influenced by male gender. Since the direct relationship between male gender and occupation is not fully quantified, we must consider the joint effect of male gender and occupation on salary. The higher probability of male gender (48%) and the direct relationship between male gender and occupation imply that male gender is likely to lead to higher occupation, which in turn leads to higher salary. This chain of causality suggests that male gender is associated with higher salaries, making it less likely than low salary overall.<|eot_id|>",
