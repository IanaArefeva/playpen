The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 2%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 24%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 74%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 93%. The overall probability of male gender is 56%. For patients who have a brother, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of recovery for patients who have a brother is 26.4% (0.24 * 0.44) and the probability of recovery for patients who do not have a brother is 26.4% (0.02 * 0.56). Since the two probabilities are equal, it is not more likely to see recovery if the patient does not have a brother.<|eot_id|>",
