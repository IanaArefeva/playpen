Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 19%. The probability of not taking medication and healthy heart is 52%. The probability of taking medication and healthy heart is 10%.

The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is that higher blood pressure is associated with a higher risk of heart condition. The probability of taking medication is 19%, and the probability of not taking medication and having a healthy heart is 52%. The probability of taking medication and having a healthy heart is 10%. The key point here is that the direct relationship between medication and heart condition is positive, meaning that medication has a beneficial effect on heart condition. This positive relationship between medication and heart condition counteracts the negative relationship between blood pressure and heart condition. Since the probability of taking medication is lower than the probability of not taking medication and having a healthy heart, the positive effect of medication on heart condition likely outweighs the negative effect of higher blood pressure on heart condition. Therefore, the chance of having a healthy heart is not smaller when observing taking medication.<|eot_id|>",
