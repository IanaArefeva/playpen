The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on black hair. Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 91%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of black hair is 50%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of black hair is 12%. Is black hair less likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since 91% of the population used tanning salon treatments, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction: (0.91 * 0.12) + (0.09 * 0.50) = 0.1092 + 0.045 = 0.1542. The probability of black hair is 0.1542, and the probability of blond hair is 0.8458 (1 - 0.1542). Since 0.1542 is less than 0.8458, black hair is less likely than blond hair.||",
