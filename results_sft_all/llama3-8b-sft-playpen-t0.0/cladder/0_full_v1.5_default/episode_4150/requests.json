The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and rainfall. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 31%. The probability of reduced supply and high rainfall is 32%. The probability of increased supply and high rainfall is 8%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing increased supply?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between demand and supply means that demand exerts a direct influence on supply. The direct relationship between yield per acre and supply also exerts an influence on supply. The direct relationship between supply and rainfall further exerts an influence on rainfall. The unobserved demand exerts an influence on both yield per acre and supply. The direct relationship between yield per acre and supply exerts an influence on both yield per acre and demand. The direct relationship between demand and supply exerts an influence on both demand and yield per acre. The direct relationship between demand and yield per acre exerts an influence on both demand and yield per acre.
