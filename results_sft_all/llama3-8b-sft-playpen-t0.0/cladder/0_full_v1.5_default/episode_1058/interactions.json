The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 5%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 26%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 77%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 98%. The overall probability of male gender is 52%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If Will is male, then the probability of his recovery is 77%. If Will is not male, then the probability of his recovery is 5%. In both scenarios, the probability of Will's recovery is less than 26%, which is the probability of recovery for male patients who are not male and are not receiving treatment. This suggests that Will's chance of recovery is not directly increased by the action of Will receiving treatment.||",
