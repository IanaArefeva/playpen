The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 55%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of high salary is 44%. For individuals who are male, the probability of high salary is 70%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since occupation has a direct effect on salary, this further solidifies the link between male gender and higher salary. The direct relationship between skill and occupation and the direct relationship between occupation and salary imply that skill is also associated with higher occupation and higher salary. Since the probability of male gender is 55%, this means that a large fraction of the population is male, and as a result, a large fraction of the population is associated with higher occupation and higher salary. This overall pattern of relationships between male gender, occupation, and salary suggests that high salary is more likely than low salary overall.||",
