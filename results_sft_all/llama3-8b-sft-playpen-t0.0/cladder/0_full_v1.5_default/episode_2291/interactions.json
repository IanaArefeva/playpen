The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 94%. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 71%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 58%. Is college admission less likely than college rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of college rejection is 1 - 0.5454 = 0.4546. Since 0.5454 is greater than 0.4546, college admission is more likely than college rejection overall.||",
