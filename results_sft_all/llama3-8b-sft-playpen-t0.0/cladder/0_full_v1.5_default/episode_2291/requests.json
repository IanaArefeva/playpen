Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 94%. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 71%.

Since the probability of smoking is 94%, the overall probability of college admission is a weighted average of the two probabilities: (0.94 * 0.58) + (0.06 * 0.71) = 0.5454. The probability of college rejection is 1 - 0.5454 = 0.4546. Since 0.5454 is greater than 0.4546, college admission is more likely than college rejection overall.<|eot_id|>",
