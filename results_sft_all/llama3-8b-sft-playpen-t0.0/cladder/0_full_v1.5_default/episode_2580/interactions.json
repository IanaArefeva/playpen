The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 66%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 1%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 65%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 34%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 65%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 34%. The overall probability of smoking is 95%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In both scenarios where the person is a smoker (with or without a high tar deposit), the probability of lung cancer is 34%. This suggests that the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is not as strong as the direct effect of tar deposit on lung cancer. In fact, the probability of lung cancer is higher for nonsmokers with a high tar deposit (34%) than for smokers with a high tar deposit (34%). This indicates that the presence of a high tar deposit is a more significant risk factor for lung cancer than the act of smoking itself.||",
