Skill has a direct effect on salary. We know that college degree or higher causes low skill level, and we know that high skill level causes low salary.

Since skill has a direct effect on salary, a lower skill level would lead to a lower salary. This chain of cause and effect means that having a college degree or higher would not lead to a high salary, but rather a lower one.<|eot_id|>",
