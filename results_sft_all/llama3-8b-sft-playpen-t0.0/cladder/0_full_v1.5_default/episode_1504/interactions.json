The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 15%. For people not blowing out candles, the probability of dark room is 86%. For people who blow out candles, the probability of dark room is 54%. Is dark room more likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of blowing out the candle is 0.15, we can weight the two probabilities by the corresponding likelihoods of each action: (0.9 * 0.85) + (0.54 * 0.15) = 0.765 + 0.081 = 0.846. The probability of bright room is 1 - 0.846 = 0.154. Since 0.846 is greater than 0.154, dark room is more likely than bright room overall.||",
