Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. We know that taking the elevator causes penguin happiness. taking the elevator and penguin happiness causes large feet.

If the person were to take the elevator, it would lead to penguin happiness, which in turn would lead to large feet. This chain of cause and effect supersedes any direct relationship between the person's decision and their foot size, as the intervening variable of penguin mood exerts a more direct influence on foot size.||",
