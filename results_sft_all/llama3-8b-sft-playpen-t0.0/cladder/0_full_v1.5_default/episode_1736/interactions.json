The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 5%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 87%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of waking up late is 5%, the probability of waking up on time is 95%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%. This means that the overall probability of arriving to school on time is (0.95) * (0.52) = 0.494, which is less than the probability of arriving to school late, which is 1 - 0.494 = 0.506.||",
