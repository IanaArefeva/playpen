The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 89%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 76%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 24%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 10%. The overall probability of old age is 42%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be less likely to see thick lips if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between hospital costs and thick lips is only through the intermediate variable of age. Since the hospital costs are already accounted for in the age variable, we need to examine the relationship between hospital costs and thick lips through the lens of age.\nFor patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 76%, which is higher than the 24% probability for patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill. This suggests that the hospital costs do not directly reduce the probability of thick lips, but rather that the hospital costs are associated with older age, which in turn is associated with lower probability of thick lips.\nTherefore, if we control for the patient's age, we would not see a reduction in the probability of thick lips when hospital costs are high compared to when hospital costs are low.||",
