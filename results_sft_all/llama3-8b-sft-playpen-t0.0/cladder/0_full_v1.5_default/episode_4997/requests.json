The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 69%. For people who do not have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 98%. For people who have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 36%. For people who have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 61%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 70%. For people who have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 55%. If we disregard the mediation effect through blood pressure, would having a sister negatively affect heart condition?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a healthy heart is lower for people who have a sister and with low blood pressure (36%) compared to those who do not have a sister and with the same blood pressure condition (69%). This might imply a negative effect of having a sister on heart condition in the context of low blood pressure.<|eot_id|>",
