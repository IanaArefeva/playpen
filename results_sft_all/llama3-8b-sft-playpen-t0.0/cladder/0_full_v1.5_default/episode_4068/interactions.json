The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 38%. For people who speak english, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key relationship is between language ability and the intermediate variable \"diabetes\". The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is also a key element. The correct chain of causality is: language ability affects diabetes, and diabetes affects long lifespan. The probability of long lifespan is lower for those who speak English (38%) than for those who do not speak English (70%). This difference in long lifespan probability is not directly due to the language ability itself but rather to the difference in the probability of diabetes between the two groups. Since the direct relationship between language ability and long lifespan is not the primary focus, we must consider the intermediate variable \"diabetes\" to fully understand the relationship. The correct chain of causality is: language ability affects diabetes, and diabetes affects long lifespan.
