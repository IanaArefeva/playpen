The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 60%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 26%. For days when Alice wakes up late, would it be more likely to see arriving to school on time if Alice had gotten up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
