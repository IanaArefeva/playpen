Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 30%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 84%.

The probability of large feet for people who used tanning salon treatments is 84%, which is higher than the 30% probability for those who did not use tanning salon treatments. This indicates that tanning salon treatment has a positive causal relationship with large foot size, rather than a negative one.<|eot_id|>",
