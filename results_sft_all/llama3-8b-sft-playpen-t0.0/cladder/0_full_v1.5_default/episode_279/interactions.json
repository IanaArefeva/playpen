The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The camper has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. For campers who do not light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 17%. For campers who light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 66%. Will the camper lighting a match increase the chance of the forest on fire?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key information is that for campers who do not light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 17%, and for those who light a match, the probability is 66%. This shows that the action of lighting a match by the camper directly affects the probability of the forest on fire, increasing it from 17% to 66%.||",
