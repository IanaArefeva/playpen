The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. For campers who do not light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 17%. For campers who light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 66%. Will the camper lighting a match increase the chance of the forest on fire?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key information is that for campers who do not light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 17%, and for those who light a match, the probability is 66%. This shows that the action of lighting a match by the camper directly affects the probability of the forest on fire, increasing it from 17% to 66%.<|eot_id|>",
