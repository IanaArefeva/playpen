The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Method 1: We look directly at how solar eclipse correlates with Alice arriving to school in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to traffic. To understand how solar eclipse affects Alice arriving to school, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This approach is necessary to control for the confounding effect of traffic, which directly affects Alice's arrival time and is also related to the solar eclipse. If we directly examine the general correlation between solar eclipse and Alice's arrival (Method 1), we risk attributing the effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival to the eclipse itself rather than to the intervening cause of traffic. By conditionally examining the relationship between solar eclipse and Alice's arrival under different levels of traffic (Method 2), we can more accurately identify the direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival, separate from the influence of traffic.||",
