The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Lip thickness has a direct effect on fame. Method 1: We look at how appearance correlates with lip thickness case by case according to fame. Method 2: We look directly at how appearance correlates with lip thickness in general. To understand how appearance affects lip thickness, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this case, looking at the direct relationship between appearance and lip thickness (Method 2) is more appropriate than looking at the relationship through the intermediate of fame (Method 1), as we want to establish the direct cause and effect between these two variables.||",
