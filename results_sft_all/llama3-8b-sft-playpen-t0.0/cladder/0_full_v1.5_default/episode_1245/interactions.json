The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 72%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 72%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 31%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 80%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the direct effect of being a smoker on lung cancer is neutralized when there is no tar deposit. Since the probability of high tar deposit is higher for smokers (80%) than for nonsmokers (31%), the higher probability of lung cancer among smokers can be attributed to the higher likelihood of having a high tar deposit, rather than any direct effect of being a smoker on lung cancer.||",
