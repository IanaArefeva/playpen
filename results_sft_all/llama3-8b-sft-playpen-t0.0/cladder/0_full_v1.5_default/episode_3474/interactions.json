The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 6%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 31%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 85%. Is large feet less likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since both tanning salon treatment and beach activities lead to larger foot size, we can conclude that large feet are more likely than small feet in this world.||",
