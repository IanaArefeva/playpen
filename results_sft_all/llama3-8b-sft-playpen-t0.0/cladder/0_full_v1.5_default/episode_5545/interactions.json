The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on full moon and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on full moon. Full moon has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of full moon is 66%. The probability of no full moon and increased price is 29%. The probability of full moon and increased price is 40%. Is the chance of increased price larger when observing full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of full moon is 66%, the probability of no full moon is 34%. The probability of no full moon and increased price is 29%, which is less than the probability of full moon and increased price (40%).
