The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of being able to swim is 8%. The probability of not being able to swim and high exam score is 36%. The probability of being able to swim and high exam score is 7%. Is the chance of high exam score larger when observing being able to swim?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
