The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 53%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 17%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 55%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 19%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 47%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 18%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 75%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 49%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 92%. Does gender positively affect brown eyes through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between male and department competitiveness is not direct; rather, it is through the unobserved variable of in-state residency. The probability of brown eyes is different for male and female in both competitive and non-competitive departments, which suggests that the direct relationship between male and brown eyes is not fully accounted for by the relationship between male and department competitiveness.||",
