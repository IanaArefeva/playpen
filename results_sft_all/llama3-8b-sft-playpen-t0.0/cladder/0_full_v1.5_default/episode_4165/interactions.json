The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of having a brother is 50%. The probability of not having a brother and recovery is 33%. The probability of having a brother and recovery is 12%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having a brother is 50%, and the probability of not having a brother and still recovering is 33%. This means that the probability of not having a brother is 50% as well. Since the probability of not having a brother and still recovering is higher than the probability of having a brother and recovering (33% vs 12%), it suggests that the chance of recovery is larger when not observing having a brother.||",
