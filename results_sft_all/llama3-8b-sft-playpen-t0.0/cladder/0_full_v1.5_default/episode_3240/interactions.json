The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of having visited England is 40%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 25%. For people who have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 69%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of an individual being fired is 0.4 * 0.69 = 0.276 for those who have visited England and 0.6 * 0.25 = 0.15 for those who have not. The overall probability of an individual being fired is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is (0.4 * 0.69) + (0.6 * 0.25) = 0.276 + 0.15 = 0.426. The probability of an individual not being fired is 1 - 0.426 = 0.574. Since 0.426 is less than 0.574, the probability of an individual being fired is less than the probability of an individual not being fired, and the correct answer is No.||",
