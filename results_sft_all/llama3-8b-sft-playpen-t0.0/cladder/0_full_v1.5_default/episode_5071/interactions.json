The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 51%. For patients who do not have a sister, the probability of low cholesterol is 43%. For patients who have a sister, the probability of low cholesterol is 25%. Is low cholesterol less likely than high cholesterol overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the direct relationship between having a sister and lower cholesterol is not offset by any counteracting relationships, we can conclude that having a sister is a cause of lower cholesterol. The direct relationship between unobserved confounders and both having a sister and lower cholesterol further solidifies this conclusion.||",
