Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 26%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 58%. Does education level positively affect salary through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, there might be additional, unexplored relationships that link education level to salary without involving skill. For instance, education level could directly influence other skills or assets that are not accounted for in the given relationships, which in turn could lead to higher salaries. The direct relationship between education and skill does not preclude the possibility of additional, skill-independent effects of education on salary.<|eot_id|>",
