The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 91%. The probability of absence of citrus and scurvy is 7%. The probability of citrus intake and scurvy is 36%. Is the chance of scurvy larger when observing citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The overall probability of scurvy is the weighted average of the two scenarios: (0.07 * 0) + (0.09 * 0.36) = 0.0324. The probability of citrus is 0.91, and the probability of scurvy given citrus is 0.36, so the probability of scurvy given citrus is 0.91 * 0.36 = 0.3264. Since 0.3264 is larger than 0.0324, the chance of scurvy is larger when observing citrus intake.||",
