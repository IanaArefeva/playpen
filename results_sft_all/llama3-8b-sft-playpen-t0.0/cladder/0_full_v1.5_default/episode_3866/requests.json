The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 84%. The probability of non-male gender and brown eyes is 12%. The probability of male gender and brown eyes is 54%. Is the chance of brown eyes larger when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The chain of causality is more complex: male gender affects department competitiveness, which in turn affects brown eyes. Since the probability of male gender is 84%, this already sets a high base rate for brown eyes. Additionally, the direct relationship between male gender and brown eyes is not as strong as the relationship between male gender and brown eyes through the intermediate variable of department competitiveness. The probability of male gender and brown eyes is 54%, which is lower than the probability of male gender (84%). This suggests that the direct relationship between male gender and brown eyes is not as strong as the chain of causality through department competitiveness.<|eot_id|>",
