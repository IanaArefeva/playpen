The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 47%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 37%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 52%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of gender on both treatment and recovery is also positive, meaning that women are more likely to receive treatment and have higher recovery rates than men. The overall probability of recovery is lower than the probability of non-recovery, which is 63% (100% - 37%). This is because the positive direct effect of treatment on recovery is offset by the lower probability of women (who are more likely to be treated) and the lower probability of recovery for those not treated.<|eot_id|>",
