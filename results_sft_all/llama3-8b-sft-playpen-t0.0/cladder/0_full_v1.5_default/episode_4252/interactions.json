The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and lip thickness. Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of receives treatment is 64%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 80%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 51%. Is thick lips more likely than thin lips overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of not receiving treatment is 36%, we can calculate the overall probability of thick lips as follows: (0.64 * 0.36) + (0.80 * 0.64) = 0.23 + 0.51 = 0.74. The probability of thick lips is higher than the probability of thin lips (1 - 0.74 = 0.26), so thick lips are more likely than thin lips overall.||",
