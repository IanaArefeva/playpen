The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on having a brother and disease. Having a brother has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of having a brother is 62%. The probability of not having a brother and recovering from the disease is 8%. The probability of having a brother and recovering from the disease is 48%. Is the chance of recovering from the disease smaller when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of disease is higher when you have a brother (48% with a brother, 0% without a brother), which means that having a brother is associated with a higher risk of disease. The probability of disease is not directly related to the probability of having a brother, and the relationship is not bidirectional. The probability of disease is higher when you have a brother, and the probability of having a brother is higher than the probability of disease (62% vs. 0%). The probability of disease is not lower when you have a brother; in fact, it is higher.||",
