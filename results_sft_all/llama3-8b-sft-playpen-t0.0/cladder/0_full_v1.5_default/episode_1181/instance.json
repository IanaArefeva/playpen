For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 27%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 67%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 90%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 52%. Will getting the vaccine increase the chance of recovering from the disease?",
