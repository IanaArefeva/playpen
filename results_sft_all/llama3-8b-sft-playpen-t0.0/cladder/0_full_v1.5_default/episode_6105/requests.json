Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender or in-state residency or competitive department causes brown eyes. We observed the resident is in-state.

Since we already know the applicant is in-state, we can conclude that brown eyes are a direct result of in-state residency. The additional condition that male gender or in-state residency or competitive department causes brown eyes further solidifies this relationship. If the applicant were non-male, we would still need to consider the possibility of brown eyes being a result of in-state residency, which we already confirmed. Therefore, we can conclude that the applicant would still have brown eyes, not blue eyes, if they were non-male.<|eot_id|>",
