The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes not having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England and director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to fire the employee. Would the employee is fired if not having visited England instead of having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The chain of causality is as follows: CEO's decision to fire the employee directly affects the director and the absence of having visited England. The absence of having visited England then directly affects the employee being fired. In this specific chain of causality, the absence of having visited England is a necessary condition for the employee being fired. If we were to condition on the absence of having visited England, we would still have the direct effect of the CEO's decision on the director and the subsequent firing of the employee. In other words, the absence of having visited England does not disrupt the direct chain of causality from the CEO's decision to the director and the employee being fired.||",
