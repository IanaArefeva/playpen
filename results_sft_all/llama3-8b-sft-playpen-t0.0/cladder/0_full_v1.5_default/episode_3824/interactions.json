The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of male gender is 55%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 64%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 49%. Is being allergic to peanuts less likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional information about the direct relationship between department competitiveness and peanut allergy further solidifies this conclusion. Since male gender is associated with higher department competitiveness, and higher department competitiveness is associated with a lower probability of being allergic to peanuts, we can conclude that being male is still associated with a lower likelihood of having a peanut allergy.||",
