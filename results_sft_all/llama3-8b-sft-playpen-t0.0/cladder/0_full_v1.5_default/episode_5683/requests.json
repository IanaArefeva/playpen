The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on having a brother and disease. Having a brother has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and do not have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 95%. For people with no pre-conditions and have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 80%. For people with pre-conditions and do not have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 30%. For people with pre-conditions and have a brother, the probability of recovering from the disease is 19%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 58%. For people who have a brother, would it be more likely to see recovering from the disease if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of having a brother and pre-conditions is 26.4% (42% of 58% of people with a brother), and the probability of having a brother and no pre-conditions is 15.6% (42% of 42% of people with a brother). The probability of having a brother and pre-conditions and not recovering from the disease is 26.4% * 81% = 21.4%. The probability of having a brother and no pre-conditions and not recovering from the disease is 15.6% * 20% = 3.12%. The probability of having a brother and not having a brother and not recovering from the disease is 26.4% + 3.12% = 29.52%. The probability of not having a brother and not recovering from the disease is 58% * 30% = 17.4%. The probability of not having a brother and not having a brother and not recovering from the disease is 42% * 30% = 12.6%.
