The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 29%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 30%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 12%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer is higher in the smoking group than in the nonsmoking group, which is a direct result of the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer. The additional information that the probability of lung cancer is 30% in the nonsmoking group further solidifies this conclusion, as it sets a clear baseline for comparison. The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer, as well as the direct relationship between tar deposit and lung cancer, ensure that the occurrence of lung cancer is more likely when there is an active smoking behavior.<|eot_id|>",
