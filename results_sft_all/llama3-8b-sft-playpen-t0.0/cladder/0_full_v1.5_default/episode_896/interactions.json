The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 5%. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 78%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 46%. Is college admission less likely than college rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between effort and college admission is that higher effort leads to higher college admission. The overall probability of college admission is a function of both the probability of not smoking (95%) and the probability of college admission for those who do not smoke (78%), which is higher than the probability of college admission for those who smoke (46%). Since the probability of college admission is higher than the probability of college rejection for those who do not smoke, and the probability of not smoking is higher than the probability of smoking, the overall probability of college admission is higher than the probability of college rejection.||",
