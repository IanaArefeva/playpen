The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and lip thickness. Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of receives treatment is 48%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 64%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 29%. Is thick lips more likely than thin lips overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the overall probability of receiving treatment is 48%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction: (0.48 * 0.29) + (0.52 * 0.64) = 0.1392 + 0.3328 = 0.472.
