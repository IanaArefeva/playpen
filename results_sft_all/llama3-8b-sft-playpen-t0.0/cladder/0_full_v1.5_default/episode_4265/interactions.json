The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 5%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 38%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 64%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 95%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 45%. Will getting the vaccine increase the chance of being lactose intolerant?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of the vaccine on lactose intolerance is positive, meaning that the vaccine increases the probability of being lactose intolerant. However, the pre-conditions have a direct effect on both the vaccine and the probability of being lactose intolerant. In particular, the pre-conditions reduce the probability of being vaccine and increase the probability of being lactose intolerant. \n\nGiven that the probability of having pre-conditions is 45%, we can conclude that the overall probability of being vaccine is less than 55% (1 - 0.45). This is because the vaccine is more likely to be taken by people without pre-conditions. \n\nNow, consider the two groups: those with no pre-conditions and those with pre-conditions. In the first group, the probability of being vaccine is higher than in the second group, and the probability of being vaccine is higher than in the second group. In the second group, the probability of being vaccine is lower than in the first group, and the probability of being vaccine is lower than in the first group. \n\nGiven that the direct effect of the vaccine on lactose intolerance is positive, we can conclude that the vaccine will increase the probability of being vaccine in both groups. In the first group, the probability of being vaccine is already higher than in the second group, so the vaccine will further increase the probability of being vaccine in",
