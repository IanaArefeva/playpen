The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and lactose intolerance. Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 14%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 25%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 87%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 98%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 47%. Will getting the vaccine increase the chance of being lactose intolerant?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of the vaccine on lactose intolerance is positive, meaning that the vaccine increases the probability of being lactose intolerant. However, the pre-conditions have a much stronger direct effect on lactose intolerance than the vaccine does. In particular, for people with pre-conditions, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 87% if they refuse the vaccine and 98% if they get the vaccine. This means that the vaccine does not increase the chance of being lactose intolerant for people with pre-conditions; in fact, it further increases the already high probability of being lactose intolerant. For people without pre-conditions, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 14% if they refuse the vaccine and 25% if they get the vaccine, so the vaccine still has a positive effect on the probability of being lactose intolerant in this group. Since the overall probability of pre-conditions is 47%, we can conclude that the vaccine will not increase the chance of being lactose intolerant on average.||",
