Skill has a direct effect on salary. We know that college degree or higher causes low skill level, and we know that high skill level causes high salary.

This is a counterintuitive relationship where higher education is associated with lower skill. In this world, the direct relationship between skill and salary is that high skill level causes high salary. Since college degree or higher is associated with a lower skill level, it would lead to a lower salary, not a higher one.<|eot_id|>",
