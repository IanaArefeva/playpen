  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 57%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 95%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 34%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 63%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 65%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 28%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect lactose intolerance?",
