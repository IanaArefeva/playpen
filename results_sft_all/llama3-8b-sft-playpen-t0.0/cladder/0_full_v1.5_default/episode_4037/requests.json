The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 57%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 95%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 34%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 63%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 65%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 28%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect lactose intolerance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between smoking and being hard-working is also a key factor. In the given world, the probability of being hard-working is lower for smokers (28%) than for nonsmokers (65%). Since being hard-working is associated with a higher probability of being lactose intolerant (95% for nonsmokers and 63% for smokers), the lower probability of being hard-working among smokers actually counteracts the direct positive relationship between smoking and lactose intolerance. This counteraction ultimately leads to a negative overall effect of smoking on the probability of being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
