The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 48%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 61%. Will full moon increase the chance of wet ground?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of the sprinkler on the ground, on the other hand, is separate from the full moon's control over the weather. Since the full moon's control over the weather is already accounted for in the 61% probability of a wet ground when there is a full moon, the additional direct effect of the sprinkler on the ground does not change the probability of a wet ground when there is a full moon. The probability of a wet ground when there is a full moon remains at 61%.||",
