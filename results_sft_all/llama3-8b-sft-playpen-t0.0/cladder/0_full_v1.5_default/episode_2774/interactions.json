The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 47%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 41%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of clean water is 50%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of clean water is 18%. Will clean water decrease the chance of cholera contraction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, we also need to consider the relationship between the water company and water quality, as well as the relationship between water quality and cholera. The direct effect of the water company on water quality is not fully quantified, and we have no direct measure of the water quality in the local water company setting. The probability of clean water in the local water company setting is 50%, which is higher than the 18% in the global water company setting, but we do not have direct information on the water quality in the local water company setting.
