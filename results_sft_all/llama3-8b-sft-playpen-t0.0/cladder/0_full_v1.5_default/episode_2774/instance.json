Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 47%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 41%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of clean water is 50%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of clean water is 18%. Will clean water decrease the chance of cholera contraction?",
