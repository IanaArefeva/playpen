The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 14%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 52%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 35%. Is being lactose intolerant more likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of intelligent parents is 14%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction: (0.14 * 0.35) + (0.86 * 0.52) = 0.049 + 0.4484 = 0.4974.
