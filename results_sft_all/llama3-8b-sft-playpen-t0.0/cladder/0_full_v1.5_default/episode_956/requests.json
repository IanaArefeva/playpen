The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 72%. For normal weight people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 55%. For obese people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 47%. For obese people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 27%. For normal weight people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 30%. For normal weight people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 6%. For obese people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 84%. For obese people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 70%. The overall probability of smoker is 41%. Does obesity positively affect lifespan through diabetes?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of having diabetes is higher for both normal weight and obese people who smoke than for those who do not smoke. This suggests that the primary driver of the relationship between obesity and diabetes is the unobserved variable of smoking, rather than a direct effect of obesity on diabetes.<|eot_id|>",
