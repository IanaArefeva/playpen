Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 57%. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 46%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 88%. Is healthy heart less likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a person having a heart condition is 1 - 0.88 = 0.12 when they take medication and 1 - 0.46 = 0.54 when they do not take medication. The overall probability of a person having a heart condition is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is (0.57 * 0.12) + (0.43 * 0.54) = 0.26. The probability of a person having a heart condition is less than the probability of a person having a heart condition when they do not take medication (0.26 < 0.54), and it is also less than the probability of a person having a heart condition when they take medication (0.26 < 0.12), which is the opposite of what we want to conclude.<|eot_id|>",
