The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 35%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 39%. For people with smoking genes, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had a nonsmoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between the gene and smoking is that people with a smoking gene are more likely to smoke. The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is that smoking directly causes lung cancer. The direct relationship between pollution and both smoking and lung cancer is that pollution directly affects both smoking and lung cancer. The key point here is that the gene's effect on lung cancer is through its effect on smoking, and the direct relationship between the gene and lung cancer is that people with a smoking gene have a higher probability of lung cancer. This means that the gene's effect on lung cancer is fully mediated by its effect on smoking. Since the person already has a smoking gene, the additional information about the person having a nonsmoking gene does not change the probability of lung cancer, which remains at 39%.||",
