The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Method 1: We look directly at how Alice waking up correlates with Alice arriving to school in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to traffic. To understand how Alice waking up affects Alice arriving to school, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is because the relationship between Alice waking up and Alice arriving to school is not direct and uniform across all scenarios. The intervening variable of \"traffic\" can change the strength and direction of this relationship. In some scenarios, Alice might wake up late and still make it to school on time if the traffic is light, while in others, she might wake up on time but get stuck in heavy traffic and be late. This means that the relationship between Alice waking up and Alice arriving to school is dependent on the specific condition of the traffic, and looking at this relationship case by case according to the traffic condition is necessary to fully understand the causal relationship.<|eot_id|>",
