The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 96%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 83%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 21%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 11%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 42%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

          "content": "No\nThe key insight here is that the treatment effect is not uniform across all patients. For those with small kidney stones, the probability of recovery is higher with treatment (83%) than without (96%). In other words, treatment actually hinders recovery for this group. In contrast, for those with large kidney stones, the probability of recovery is lower with treatment (11%) than without (21%). This suggests that the treatment is counterproductive for large kidney stone patients. Since the overall probability of large kidney stone is 42%, we can conclude that, for patients receiving treatment, it is less likely to see recovery if the patient had not been treated, especially given the higher probability of large kidney stone in the general population.||",
