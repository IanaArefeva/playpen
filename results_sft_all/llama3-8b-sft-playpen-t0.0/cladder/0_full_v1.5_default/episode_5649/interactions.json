The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of speaking english is 63%. The probability of not speaking english and recovery is 9%. The probability of speaking english and recovery is 39%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
