The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 96%. The probability of nonsmoking and freckles is 2%. The probability of smoking and freckles is 65%. Is the chance of freckles smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of freckles is also directly related to the probability of not smoking, which is 4% (100% - 96% of the population smokes). Since the probability of freckles is 2% in the general population and 65% in the smoking subpopulation, we can conclude that the chance of freckles is larger when observing smoking, not smaller.||",
