The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 9%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 58%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 32%. Is scurvy less likely than no scurvy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of citrus consumption is 9%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction to find the overall probability of scurvy: (0.09) * 32% + (0.91) * 58% = 5.28% + 52.98% = 58.26%.
