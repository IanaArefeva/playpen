The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 71%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 68%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This reduction is a direct result of the condition that being male has a direct negative effect on the probability of admission acceptance. The counterfactual scenario of not being male would still lead to a 71% probability of admission acceptance, which is higher than the 68% probability associated with being male.<|eot_id|>",
