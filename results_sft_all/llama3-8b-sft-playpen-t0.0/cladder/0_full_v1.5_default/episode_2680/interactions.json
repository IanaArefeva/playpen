The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking gene is 89%. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 47%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 53%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of having the smoking gene is 0.89, the overall probability of lung cancer is 0.5*0.89 + 0.47*(1-0.89) = 0.5*0.89 + 0.47*0.11 = 0.4455 + 0.0517 = 0.4972. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.4972 = 0.5028. Since 0.4972 is less than 0.5028, lung cancer is less likely than absence of lung cancer overall.||",
