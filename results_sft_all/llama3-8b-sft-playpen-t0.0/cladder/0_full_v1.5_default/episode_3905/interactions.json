The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 22%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 62%. For individuals who have visited England, would it be less likely to see high salary if the individual had not visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we are focusing on the scenario where an individual has already made the trip to England, we can condition on this event and examine the relationship between skill and salary. In this case, the probability of a high salary is 62% for those who have made the trip, which is higher than the 22% probability for those who haven't made the trip. This suggests that the positive effect of visiting England on salary is not entirely offset by the absence of skill, and that skill still exerts a positive influence on salary even after controlling for the visit to England.||",
