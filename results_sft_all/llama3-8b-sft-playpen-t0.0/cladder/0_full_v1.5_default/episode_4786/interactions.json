The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on rainfall. Sprinkler has a direct effect on rainfall. For people in the dry season, the probability of high rainfall is 46%. For in the rainy season, the probability of high rainfall is 64%. Will rainy season increase the chance of high rainfall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between the season and weather is also clear, with the weather being different in the two seasons. The direct relationship between the sprinkler and rainfall is also clear, with the sprinkler being a direct cause of rainfall. The probability of high rainfall in the rainy season is 64%, which is higher than the 46% in the dry season. This suggests that the weather in the rainy season is more likely to lead to high rainfall than the weather in the dry season. The direct relationship between the season and weather, and the direct relationship between the weather and rainfall, imply that the weather in the rainy season is more likely to lead to high rainfall than the weather in the dry season.||",
