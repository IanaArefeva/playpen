The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender or in-state residency or competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the resident is in-state. Would the applicant gets admitted if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that the applicant is in-state (and in-state residency is a direct cause of competitive department), we can conclude that the in-state residency is the primary cause of the competitive department. The male gender is not necessary for the competitive department in this case, as the in-state residency already guarantees it. Therefore, if we change the male gender to a non-male gender, the competitive department will still be present, and the direct effect of the competitive department on admission acceptance will still lead to admission.||",
