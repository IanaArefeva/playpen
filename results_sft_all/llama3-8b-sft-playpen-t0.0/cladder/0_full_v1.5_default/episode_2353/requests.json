Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 75%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 42%.

The correct understanding is that citrus consumption directly affects the body's stores of vitamin C, which in turn affects the risk of scurvy. In this world, citrus consumption does not directly increase the chance of scurvy; rather, it directly affects the body's stores of vitamin C, which then affects the risk of scurvy. The 42% probability of scurvy among citrus consumers is lower than the 75% probability among non citrus consumers, which further supports the idea that citrus consumption does not increase the chance of scurvy.<|eot_id|>",
