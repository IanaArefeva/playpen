The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 27%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 41%. Does having a brother positively affect salary through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of high salary is higher for those with a brother (41%) than for those without a brother (27%), but this difference in probability is not entirely explained by the difference in skill levels between the two groups. The direct effect of having a brother on skill is not fully mediated by the relationship between skill and salary, so we conclude that having a brother does not positively affect salary through skill.||",
