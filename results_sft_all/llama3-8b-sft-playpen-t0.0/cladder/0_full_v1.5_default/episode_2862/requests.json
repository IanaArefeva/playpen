Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that waking up late or heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is heavy traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if waking up on time instead of waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The only direct relationship we have is that Alice's arrival at school is directly affected by both her waking up and the state of the traffic. Since we already know that there is heavy traffic, which directly affects Alice's arrival at school, we need more information about the direct relationship between Alice's waking up and her arrival at school to conclude that she would arrive on time if she woke up on time.<|eot_id|>",
