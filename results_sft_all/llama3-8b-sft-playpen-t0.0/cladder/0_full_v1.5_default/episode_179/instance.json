  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of the captain's order to execute the prisoner is 52%. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 39%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 47%. Is the prisoner's death less likely than the prisoner being alive overall?",
