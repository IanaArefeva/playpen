  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 46%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 21%. For infants with smoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 74%. For infants with smoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 47%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 51%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 72%. For infants with smoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 3%. For infants with smoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 35%. The overall probability of good health is 90%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would maternal smoking status negatively affect freckles?",
