The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drinking coffee and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 47%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of high salary is 47%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of high salary is 90%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The unobserved confounder's direct effect on both coffee consumption and salary further muddies the waters, but the strong positive relationship between coffee consumption and higher salary still holds. The 47% probability of high salary among those who do not drink coffee and the 47% probability of high salary among those who do drink coffee indicate that the unobserved confounder's effect on salary is not strong enough to counteract the positive effect of coffee consumption on salary.||",
