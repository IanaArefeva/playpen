Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who do not like spicy food, the probability of high salary is 46%. For individuals who like spicy food, the probability of high salary is 31%. Will liking spicy food decrease the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of high salary is lower for those who like spicy food (31%) than for those who do not (46%), we can conclude that, in this world, liking spicy food does not decrease the chance of high salary.<|eot_id|>",
