The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 55%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 62%. Will full moon decrease the chance of wet ground?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional information that the probability of a full moon is associated with a 62% chance of a wet ground, which is higher than the 55% chance in the absence of a full moon, suggests that the full moon is not decreasing the chance of a wet ground but rather increasing it.||",
