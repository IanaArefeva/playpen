The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and freckles. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on freckles. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of clean water is 33%. The probability of polluted water and freckles is 23%. The probability of clean water and freckles is 24%. Is the chance of freckles larger when observing clean water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
