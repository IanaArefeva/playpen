The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 39%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 51%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 57%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of smoking is 39%, this subpopulation is larger than the 51% of the total population that is at risk of lung cancer in the absence of smoke. The higher risk of lung cancer among smokers, in combination with the larger size of the smoking subpopulation, means that the overall probability of lung cancer is less than 50%.<|eot_id|>",
