The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of having a sister is 73%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 24%. For people who have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 71%. Is the prisoner's death more likely than the prisoner being alive overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since 73% of the population has a sister, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction: (0.73 * 0.71) + (0.27 * 0.24) = 0.52 + 0.0624 = 0.5824. The probability of the prisoner's death is less than 0.5, so the prisoner is more likely to be alive than to have died.||",
