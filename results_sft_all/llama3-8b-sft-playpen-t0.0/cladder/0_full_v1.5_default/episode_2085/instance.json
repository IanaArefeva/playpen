  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 95%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 74%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 72%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 45%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 60%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 31%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would encouragement level positively affect exam score?",
