The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 95%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 74%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 72%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 45%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 60%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 31%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would encouragement level positively affect exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the case of students who are not encouraged and study hard, the exam score is higher than in the case of students who are not encouraged and do not study hard. This suggests that studying habits play a more significant role than encouragement in determining exam scores.<|eot_id|>",
