The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 68%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 73%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 42%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 49%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 17%. The overall probability of high pollution is 53%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would gene positively affect lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The gene also affects the likelihood of smoking, which in turn affects the likelihood of lung cancer. If we consider the joint effect of the gene and the unobserved pollution on lung cancer, we need to account for the different smoking habits across different groups. The gene's direct effect on lung cancer is not the only thing that matters; its effect on smoking habits also plays a role. The correct approach involves looking at the joint distribution of the gene, smoking habits, and lung cancer, rather than focusing on the direct relationship between the gene and lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
