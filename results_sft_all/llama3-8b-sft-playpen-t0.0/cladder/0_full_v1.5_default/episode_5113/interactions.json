The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 24%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 50%. Will having a brother increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of high salary is higher for those who have a brother (50%) than for those who do not (24%), which might lead one to conclude that having a brother is associated with a higher chance of high salary. However, the direct relationship between having a brother and skill is not quantified, and the intervening variable of skill is not fully accounted for in the given information. A more complete understanding of the relationships between having a brother, skill, and salary is required to conclude that having a brother directly increases the chance of high salary.||",
