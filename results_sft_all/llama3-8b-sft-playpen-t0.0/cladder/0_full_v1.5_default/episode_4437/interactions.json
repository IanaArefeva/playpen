The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how smoking correlates with peanut allergy in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to gender. To understand how smoking affects peanut allergy, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In such a case, looking at the general relationship between smoking and peanut allergy (Method 1) would lead to an underestimation of the effect of smoking on peanut allergy in women, since the direct effect of smoking on peanut allergy is larger in women than in men. In contrast, looking at the relationship between smoking and peanut allergy case by case according to gender (Method 2) would reveal the correct interaction and provide a more accurate picture of how smoking affects peanut allergy in each subpopulation.||",
