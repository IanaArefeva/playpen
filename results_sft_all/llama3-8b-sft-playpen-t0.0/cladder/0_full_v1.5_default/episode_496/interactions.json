The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 55%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 17%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 17%. Is talent more likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of being unattractive is 45% (100% - 55% probability of being attractive), the overall probability of having talent is 0.45 * 0.17 = 0.0765. The probability of lacking talent is 1 - 0.0765 = 0.9235. Since 0.9235 is greater than 0.0765, we conclude that lacking talent is more likely than having talent overall.||",
