The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of high salary is 60%. For individuals who are male, the probability of high salary is 39%. For individuals who are male, would it be less likely to see high salary if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The male status is a direct cause of lower probability of high salary, but this does not imply that removing the male status would lead to a higher probability of high salary. The correct relationship is that being male is a direct cause of lower probability of high salary, and removing the male status would lead to a higher probability of high salary, not the other way around.||",
