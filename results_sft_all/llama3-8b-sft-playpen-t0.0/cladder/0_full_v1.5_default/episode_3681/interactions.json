The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 43%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 81%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be less likely to see black hair if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of black hair is higher for those with a college degree or higher (81%) than for those without a college degree (43%), we can conclude that the educational background directly affects the likelihood of black hair. The skill acquired through higher education likely plays a role in this relationship. If we consider a person with a college degree or higher, their higher educational background directly affects their skill, which in turn affects the likelihood of black hair. If we then consider this person without a college degree, we are still looking at the same person, and their educational background remains the same. The skill acquired through higher education still directly affects the likelihood of black hair. Therefore, it is not less likely to see black hair if the person had not had a college degree, as the educational background still exerts its direct effect on black hair through the intermediate variable \"skill\".||",
