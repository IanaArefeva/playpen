The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Brown eyes has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 93%. For students who are not talented and rejected from elite institutions, the probability of brown eyes is 99%. For students who are not talented and accepted to elite institutions, the probability of brown eyes is 93%. For students who are talented and rejected from elite institutions, the probability of brown eyes is 97%. For students who are talented and accepted to elite institutions, the probability of brown eyes is 92%. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does the chance of brown eyes decrease when talent?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
