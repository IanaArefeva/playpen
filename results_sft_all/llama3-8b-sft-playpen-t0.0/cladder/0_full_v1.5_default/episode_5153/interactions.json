The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Brown eyes has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between talent and brown eyes is -0.01. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does it mean that talent affects brown eyes?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
