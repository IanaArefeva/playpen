Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 83%. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 44%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 48%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 6%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 35%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 38%. For managers who sign termination letters, would it be more likely to see large feet if the manager had signed the termination letter?",
