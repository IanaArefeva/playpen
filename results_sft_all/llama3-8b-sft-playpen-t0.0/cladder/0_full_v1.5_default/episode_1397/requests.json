Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 14%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 34%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the person is already a smoker, the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is already accounted for. The additional information that the person was a nonsmoker in the past does not change the direct effect of current smoking on lung cancer. The past behavior of being a nonsmoker does not directly influence the current risk of lung cancer in a smoker.<|eot_id|>",
