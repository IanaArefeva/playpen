This is because the relationship between two variables can be confounded by a third variable. In this case, the third variable is \"fame\" (fame being the cause of both the positive relationship between English and talent and the negative relationship between English and talent). The negative correlation between English and talent among famous people is likely due to the fact that famous people who speak English are more likely to have other skills or assets that make them famous, which in turn reduce their reliance on English language skills.<|eot_id|>",
