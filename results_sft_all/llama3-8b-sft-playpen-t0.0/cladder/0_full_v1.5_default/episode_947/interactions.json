The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 91%. For normal weight people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 71%. For obese people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 69%. For obese people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 43%. For normal weight people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 28%. For normal weight people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 20%. For obese people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 57%. For obese people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 70%. The overall probability of smoker is 8%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would obesity positively affect lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
