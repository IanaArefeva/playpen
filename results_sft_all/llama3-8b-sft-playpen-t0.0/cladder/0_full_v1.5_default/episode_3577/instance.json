  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Method 1: We look directly at how having a brother correlates with smallpox survival in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to vaccination reaction. To understand how having a brother affects smallpox survival, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?",
