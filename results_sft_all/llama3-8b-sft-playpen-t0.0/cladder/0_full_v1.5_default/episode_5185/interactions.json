The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. Method 1: We look at how encouragement level correlates with brown eyes case by case according to studying habit. Method 2: We look directly at how encouragement level correlates with brown eyes in general. To understand how encouragement level affects brown eyes, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the direct relationship between encouragement level and brown eyes is confounded by the intervening variable \"studying habit\". In other words, the relationship between encouragement level and brown eyes is not direct but rather through the intermediate variable \"studying habit\". To disentangle this relationship, we need to control for \"studying habit\" by looking at how encouragement level affects brown eyes case by case, as done in Method 1. This approach allows us to account for the potential bias introduced by \"studying habit\" and provide a more accurate representation of the relationship between encouragement level and brown eyes.||",
