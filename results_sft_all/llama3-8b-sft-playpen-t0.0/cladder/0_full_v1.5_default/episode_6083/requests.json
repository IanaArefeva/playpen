Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. We know that being able to swim causes studying hard. being able to swim and studying hard causes high exam score.

If the person is not able to swim, then they will not study hard, and as a result, their exam score will be lower. The direct relationship between being able to swim and exam score is not strong enough to counteract the negative effect of not being able to swim on exam score through the intermediate variable \"studing habits\".<|eot_id|>",
