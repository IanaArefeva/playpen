The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 20%. The probability of absence of citrus and curly hair is 58%. The probability of citrus intake and curly hair is 11%. Is the chance of curly hair larger when observing citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the probability of citrus and curly hair is less than the probability of citrus (20%) and less than the probability of curly hair (since the probability of citrus and curly hair is less than the probability of citrus, and the probability of citrus and curly hair is also less than the probability of curly hair). This suggests that the chance of curly hair is not larger when observing citrus intake, and in fact, the chance of curly hair is likely lower when observing citrus intake.||",
