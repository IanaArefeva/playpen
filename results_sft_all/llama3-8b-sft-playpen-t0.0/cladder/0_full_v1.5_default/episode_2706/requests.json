Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 29%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. Does smoking negatively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is separate from the direct effect of tar deposit on lung cancer. The probability of lung cancer among smokers (64%) is higher than among nonsmokers (29%), which directly indicates a positive relationship between smoking and lung cancer. The role of tar deposit is distinct from this direct relationship, as it is a separate intervening variable that affects lung cancer but is not the primary cause of the higher risk among smokers.<|eot_id|>",
