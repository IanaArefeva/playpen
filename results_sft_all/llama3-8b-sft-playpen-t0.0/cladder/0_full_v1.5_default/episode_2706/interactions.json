The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 29%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. Does smoking negatively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is separate from the direct effect of tar deposit on lung cancer. The probability of lung cancer among smokers (64%) is higher than among nonsmokers (29%), which directly indicates a positive relationship between smoking and lung cancer. The role of tar deposit is distinct from this direct relationship, as it is a separate intervening variable that affects lung cancer but is not the primary cause of the higher risk among smokers.||",
