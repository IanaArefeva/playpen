Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. We know that being able to swim causes lack of studying. being able to swim and studying hard causes high exam score. Would the student has a high exam score if not being able to swim instead of being able to swim?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If the student is not being able to swim, then we can conclude that they will study hard (since being able to swim is the only condition that would lead to a lack of studying). With a studying habits of \"studies hard\", we can then conclude that the exam score will be \"high\" (since being able to swim and studying hard is the only condition that leads to a high exam score).<|eot_id|>",
