The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 37%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 41%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 26%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer is higher in the smoking group than in the nonsmoking group, which is 26% compared to 41%. This difference in risk directly associated with the behavior of smoking, rather than the unobserved condition of being male or female, means that the chance of lung cancer is larger when not observing smoking.||",
