Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. We know that taking the elevator causes penguin happiness. taking the elevator and penguin happiness causes large feet. Would the person has large feet if taking the elevator instead of taking the stairs?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
