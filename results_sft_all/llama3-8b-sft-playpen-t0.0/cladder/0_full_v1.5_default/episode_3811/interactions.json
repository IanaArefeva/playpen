The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. Method 1: We look at how ability to swim correlates with exam score case by case according to studying habit. Method 2: We look directly at how ability to swim correlates with exam score in general. To understand how ability to swim affects exam score, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In other words, the relationship between ability to swim and exam score is not direct but rather indirect through the studying habits of the individual. If we look at the general relationship between ability to swim and exam score (Method 2), we would likely find a spurious relationship that does not account for the intervening variable. In contrast, looking at the relationship between ability to swim and exam score case by case according to studying habits (Method 1) allows us to control for the intervening variable and more accurately estimate the direct effect of ability to swim on exam score.||",
