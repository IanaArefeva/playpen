Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 44%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 79%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 20%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 46%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 35%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 58%. The overall probability of smoking is 59%.
