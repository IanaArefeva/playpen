The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 46%. The probability of low hospital bill and recovery is 34%. The probability of high hospital bill and recovery is 8%. Is the chance of recovery smaller when observing high hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The joint probability of a high hospital bill and recovery is 8%, which is lower than the individual probability of a high hospital bill (46%) and the individual probability of recovery (34%). This suggests that the relationship between hospital costs and recovery is not as direct as it might initially seem. In particular, the high hospital bill might be a sign of more severe illnesses, which in turn reduce the chance of recovery. This subtlety in the relationship between hospital costs and recovery means that the chance of recovery is not directly smaller when observing a high hospital bill.||",
