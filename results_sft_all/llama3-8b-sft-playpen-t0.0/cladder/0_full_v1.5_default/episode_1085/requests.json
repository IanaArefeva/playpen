Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 46%. The probability of low hospital bill and recovery is 34%. The probability of high hospital bill and recovery is 8%.

The joint probability of a high hospital bill and recovery is 8%, which is lower than the individual probability of a high hospital bill (46%) and the individual probability of recovery (34%). This suggests that the relationship between hospital costs and recovery is not as direct as it might initially seem. In particular, the high hospital bill might be a sign of more severe illnesses, which in turn reduce the chance of recovery. This subtlety in the relationship between hospital costs and recovery means that the chance of recovery is not directly smaller when observing a high hospital bill.<|eot_id|>",
