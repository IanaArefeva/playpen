The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and rainfall. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 61%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of high rainfall is 77%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of high rainfall is 46%. Is high rainfall more likely than low rainfall overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the overall probability of increased supply is 61%, we can weight the probabilities of high rainfall in each situation by the probability of that situation. The probability of high rainfall in the entire system is then (0.61 * 0.46) + (0.39 * 0.77) = 0.2834 + 0.3003 = 0.5837. The probability of low rainfall is 1 - 0.5837 = 0.4163. Since 0.5837 is greater than 0.4163, high rainfall is more likely than low rainfall in this system.||",
