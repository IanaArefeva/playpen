Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 80%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, this suggests that the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is positive. The intermediate role of tar deposit does not change the direction of this relationship. In this world, the direct link between smoking and lung cancer is what primarily affects the probability of lung cancer for smokers. The additional step through tar deposit does not imply that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is inverted for smokers compared to nonsmokers.<|eot_id|>",
