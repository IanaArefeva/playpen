Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes sufficient vitamin C, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes no scurvy.

If citrus is absent, then the direct cause of vitamin C is also absent, and since we know that citrus is necessary for sufficient vitamin C, the absence of citrus would lead to a lack of sufficient vitamin C. Since we also know that a lack of sufficient vitamin C directly leads to scurvy, the absence of citrus would lead to scurvy.<|eot_id|>",
