Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 43%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 11%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 11%. Is talent more likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being unattractive is 57% (100% - 43% probability of being attractive), the overall probability of having talent is 0.57 * 0.11 = 0.0627. The probability of lacking talent is 1 - 0.0627 = 0.9373. Since 0.9373 is greater than 0.0627, we conclude that talent is less likely than a lack of talent overall.<|eot_id|>",
