The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and foot size. Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are sad, the probability of large feet is 15%. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are happy, the probability of large feet is 63%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are sad, the probability of large feet is 29%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are happy, the probability of large feet is 77%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin happiness is 64%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin happiness is 40%. Does my decision positively affect foot size through penguin mood?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key relationship is between penguin mood and foot size, which is direct.
