The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. Method 1: We look directly at how encouragement level correlates with exam score in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to studying habit. To understand how encouragement level affects exam score, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In other words, the encouragement level exerts its effect on exam score through the studying habits. If we look at the general correlation between encouragement level and exam score (Method 1), we risk confounding the direct relationship with the intervening variable of studying habits. In this case, we should instead examine the relationship between encouragement level and exam score on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the studying habits of each individual (Method 2), to ensure we are not misattributing the effect of encouragement level on exam score through the studying habits.||",
