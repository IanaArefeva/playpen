The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of having visited England is 50%. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 62%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 72%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of having a high salary is higher for those who have visited England (72%) than for those who haven't (62%), we can conclude that having visited England has a positive effect on salary. This positive effect on salary, in turn, likely affects occupation, as higher salaries often lead to higher social status and more demanding roles. Since the direct effect of having visited England on occupation and salary is not fully accounted for by the given relationships, we must consider the possibility that the positive effect of having visited England on occupation and salary could lead to a higher probability of having a high salary than a low salary overall.||",
