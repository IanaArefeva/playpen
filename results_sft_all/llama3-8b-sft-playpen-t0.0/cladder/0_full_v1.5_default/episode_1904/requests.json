The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 81%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 92%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 92%. Is talent more likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being unattractive is 19% (100% - 81%), we can conclude that the number of unattractive people with talent is 0.19 * 0.92 = 0.1748, and the number of unattractive people without talent is 0.19 * (1 - 0.92) = 0.019. In contrast, the number of attractive people with talent is 0.81 * 0.92 = 0.7468, and the number of attractive people without talent is 0.81 * (1 - 0.92) = 0.0732. Since the number of unattractive people with talent is less than the number of unattractive people without talent, and the number of unattractive people is less than the number of attractive people, the total number of people with talent is less than the total number of people without talent.<|eot_id|>",
