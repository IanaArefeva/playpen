The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 17%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 70%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 8%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 51%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 75%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 14%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender negatively affect lactose intolerance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Males have a higher probability of being lactose intolerant than females in both competitive and non-competitive departments. The direct effect of being male on the probability of being lactose intolerant is higher than the direct effect of being not male on the same probability.<|eot_id|>",
