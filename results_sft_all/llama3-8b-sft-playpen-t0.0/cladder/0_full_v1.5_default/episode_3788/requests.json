The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who cannot swim and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 23%. For students who cannot swim and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 45%. For students who can swim and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 52%. For students who can swim and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 80%. For students who cannot swim, the probability of studying hard is 25%. For students who can swim, the probability of studying hard is 48%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would ability to swim positively affect exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the absence of studying habits, the exam score is higher for those who can't swim (52%) than for those who can swim (45%). This counterintuitive finding suggests that the direct effect of ability to swim on exam score is negative, rather than positive.<|eot_id|>",
