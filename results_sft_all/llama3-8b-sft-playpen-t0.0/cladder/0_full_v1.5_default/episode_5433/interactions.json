The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and freckles. Effort has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of smoking is 87%. The probability of nonsmoking and freckles is 7%. The probability of smoking and freckles is 34%. Is the chance of freckles smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between effort and freckles is also positive, meaning that higher effort directly leads to more freckles. Since the probability of smoking is 87%, and the probability of both smoking and freckles is 34%, it's clear that the occurrence of freckles is more likely when someone smokes than when they don't. The additional positive relationship between effort and freckles further solidifies this connection, as higher effort directly leads to more freckles.||",
