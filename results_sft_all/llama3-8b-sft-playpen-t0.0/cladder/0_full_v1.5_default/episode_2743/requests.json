The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 15%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 7%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 47%. Is normal infant birth weight more likely than low infant birth weight overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of normal birth weight for an infant with a smoking mother is 0.15 * 0.47 = 0.0705, and the probability of normal birth weight for an infant with a nonsmoking mother is 0.85 * 0.07 = 0.0595. The total probability of normal birth weight is 0.0705 + 0.0595 = 0.130. The probability of normal birth weight is less than the probability of low birth weight, which is 1 - 0.130 = 0.870.<|eot_id|>",
