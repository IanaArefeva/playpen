The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that intelligent parents or confounder active causes high parental social status. intelligent parents and confounder active and high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder active. Would the child is intelligent if intelligent parents instead of unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This creates a potential confounding situation where the relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence might be spurious, meaning that the observed association could be due to the unobserved confounder rather than a direct causal link.\nGiven that we already know that the confounder is active, we need to carefully consider the relationships between the variables. The direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is still present, but we also need to account for the fact that parents' social status is a mediating variable that affects child's intelligence.\nIn this scenario, if we were to change the parents from intelligent to unintelligent, we would likely see a reduction in parents' social status, which in turn would reduce child's intelligence. This is because the direct effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence would still be present, even if the parents' intelligence is lower.\nTherefore, based on the given relationships and the active confounder, we conclude that the child would not be intelligent if intelligent parents instead of unintelligent parents.<|eot_id|>",
