Treatment assignment has a direct effect on drug taken. Drug taken has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 11%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 11%. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 85%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 51%. Will taking of all assigned drugs decrease the chance of low cholesterol?",
