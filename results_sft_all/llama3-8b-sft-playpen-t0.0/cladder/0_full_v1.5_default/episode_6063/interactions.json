The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. We know that college degree or higher causes high skill level, and we know that high skill level causes black hair. Would the employee has black hair if college degree or higher instead of high school degree or lower?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
