The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 81%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 40%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 86%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 30%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 53%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 13%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 47%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 5%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 94%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect brown eyes?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only direct relationship we have is that between brown eyes and department competitiveness, which is not a direct function of gender.
