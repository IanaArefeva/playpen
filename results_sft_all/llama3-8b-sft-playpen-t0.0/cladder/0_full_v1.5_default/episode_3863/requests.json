The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 81%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 40%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 86%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of brown eyes is 30%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 53%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 13%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 47%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 5%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 94%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect brown eyes?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of brown eyes for different groups of people (male and female, in-state and out-of-state) is not directly related to their gender. The only direct relationship we have is that between brown eyes and department competitiveness, which is not a direct function of gender. The probability of brown eyes for different groups of people is more closely related to their department competitiveness than to their gender.<|eot_id|>",
