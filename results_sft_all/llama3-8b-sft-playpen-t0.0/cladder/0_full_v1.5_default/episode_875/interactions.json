The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 46%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 41%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 66%. Is intelligent child more likely than unintelligent child overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The unobserved \"other unobserved factors\" also have a direct effect on both parents' social status and child's intelligence. This means that the relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence is not entirely direct, and there are intervening variables that can influence the outcome.\nGiven that the probability of intelligent parents is 46%, we can conclude that there is a higher likelihood of children being intelligent when their parents are intelligent. This is because the direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is positive (66% probability of intelligent child when parents are intelligent).\nHowever, we also need to consider the effect of the unobserved \"other unobserved factors\" on child's intelligence. Since these factors have a direct effect on both parents' social status and child's intelligence, they can potentially counteract the positive effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence.\nGiven that the probability of intelligent child is 41% when parents are unintelligent, we can conclude that the unobserved \"other unobserved factors\" have a net negative effect on child's intelligence. This is because the probability of intelligent child is lower when parents are unintelligent, which suggests that the unobserved factors are not fully offsetting the negative effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence.\nTaking both effects into account, we can conclude that the overall probability of intelligent",
