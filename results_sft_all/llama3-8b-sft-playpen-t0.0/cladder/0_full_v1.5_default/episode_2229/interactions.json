The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Personality has a direct effect on relationship status. Appearance has a direct effect on relationship status. For people in a relationship, the correlation between kindness and attractive appearance is -0.01. If we look at people in a relationship, does it mean that kindness does not affect attractive appearance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
