Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. We know that vaccination causes having smallpox and severe vaccination reaction. having smallpox or severe vaccination reaction causes smallpox survival. Would the person dies from smallpox if lack of vaccination instead of vaccination?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between vaccination and having smallpox means that if the person is not vaccinated, they are more likely to get smallpox. Since having smallpox is associated with smallpox survival, the person is likely to survive smallpox if they are not vaccinated.<|eot_id|>",
