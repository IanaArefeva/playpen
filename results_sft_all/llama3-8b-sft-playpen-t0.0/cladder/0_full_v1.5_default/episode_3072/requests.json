The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. We know that smoking mother and good health causes normal infant birth weight. smoking mother or good health or normal infant birth weight causes high infant mortality. We observed the person has poor health. Would infant mortality is high if smoking mother instead of nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that the person has poor health, the direct effect of health condition on birth weight and infant mortality is already accounted for. The direct effect of the person's health condition on birth weight and infant mortality supersedes any potential direct or indirect effects of the person's mother's smoking status. In this specific case, the person's health condition is the primary driver of both birth weight and infant mortality, and the mother's smoking status does not play a role in determining the person's birth weight or infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
