The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 17%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 40%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 31%. Is admission acceptance more likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of male gender is 17%, this means that 83% of the population is not male. For this 83%, the probability of admission acceptance is 40%. In the 17% of the male population, the probability of admission acceptance is 31%. The overall probability of admission acceptance is then a weighted average of these two probabilities: (0.83 * 0.4) + (0.17 * 0.31) = 0.3433. The probability of admission rejection is 1 - 0.3433 = 0.6567. Since 0.6567 is greater than 0.3433, admission rejection is more likely than admission acceptance overall.||",
