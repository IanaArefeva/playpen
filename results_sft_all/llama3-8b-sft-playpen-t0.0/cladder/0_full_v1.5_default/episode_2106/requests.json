Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 17%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 40%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 31%. Is admission acceptance more likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of male gender is 17%, this means that 83% of the population is not male. For this 83%, the probability of admission acceptance is 40%. In the 17% of the male population, the probability of admission acceptance is 31%. The overall probability of admission acceptance is then a weighted average of these two probabilities: (0.83 * 0.4) + (0.17 * 0.31) = 0.3433. The probability of admission rejection is 1 - 0.3433 = 0.6567. Since 0.6567 is greater than 0.3433, admission rejection is more likely than admission acceptance overall.<|eot_id|>",
