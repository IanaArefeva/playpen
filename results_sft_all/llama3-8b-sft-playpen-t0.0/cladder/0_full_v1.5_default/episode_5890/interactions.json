The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a brother and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Having a brother has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a brother is 31%. For infants who do not have a brother, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 5%. For infants who have a brother, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 38%. Is normal infant birth weight less likely than low infant birth weight overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between unobserved confounders and both having a brother and normal infant birth weight is also positive, as unobserved confounders lead to both higher likelihoods of having a brother and normal birth weight. The direct relationship between cigarette tax and having a brother is also positive, as higher cigarette tax leads to higher likelihood of having a brother. Since the direct relationships between the variables are positive, and there are no negative direct relationships, we conclude that normal infant birth weight is more likely than low infant birth weight overall.||",
