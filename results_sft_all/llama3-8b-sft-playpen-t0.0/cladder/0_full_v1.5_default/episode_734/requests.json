The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 50%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 42%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 49%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of male gender is 50%, this means that half of the population is male and, by extension, has a higher chance of being admitted. This directly counters the idea that admission acceptance is less likely than admission rejection overall.<|eot_id|>",
