The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 99%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 88%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 32%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 18%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 59%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the primary driver of the difference in recovery rates is the size of the kidney stone rather than the treatment itself. In particular, the large difference in recovery probability between those with small and large kidney stones (99% vs 32% without treatment, and 88% vs 18% with treatment) indicates that the size of the kidney stone is the primary causal factor. Since the probability of large kidney stone is 59%, this means that most patients will have large kidney stones, and the treatment will not make a significant difference in their recovery probability. In other words, the treatment is not likely to change the recovery probability for most patients, and the size of the kidney stone remains the primary driver of the difference in recovery rates.<|eot_id|>",
