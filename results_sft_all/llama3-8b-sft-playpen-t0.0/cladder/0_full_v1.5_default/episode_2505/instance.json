Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 99%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 88%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 32%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 18%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 59%.
