The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 63%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 26%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 27%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 14%. The overall probability of smoking is 21%. Does smoking positively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not fully captured by the given probabilities, which focus on the joint effects of smoking and tar deposit on lung cancer. The correct approach involves examining the joint probability of smoking and high tar deposit, then looking at the subsequent probability of lung cancer in that joint state. The probability of high tar deposit given smoking is 26%, and the probability of lung cancer given both smoking and high tar deposit is 14%. This joint probability of 26% (smoking) and 14% (lung cancer given both) is less than the probability of lung cancer in the state of no smoking and no tar deposit (61%). This finding suggests that the positive relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not fully accounted for by the intervening variable of tar deposit, and that there might be an unobserved direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer.||",
