The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 16%. For individuals who have not visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 60%. For individuals who have visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 22%. For individuals who have visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 56%. For individuals who have not visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 30%. For individuals who have not visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 34%. For individuals who have visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 58%. For individuals who have visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 67%. The overall probability of high skill level is 9%. If we disregard the mediation effect through occupation, would having visited England positively affect salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The table only shows the probability of high salary for different subgroups, but it does not provide direct evidence of the effect of having visited England on salary. The only direct relationship we can see is that having visited England has a direct effect on occupation, and occupation has a direct effect on salary, but we do not have direct information about the relationship between having visited England and salary.<|eot_id|>",
