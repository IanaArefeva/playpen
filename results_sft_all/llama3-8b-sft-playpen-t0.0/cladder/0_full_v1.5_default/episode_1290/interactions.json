The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 36%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 84%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 12%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 15%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 50%. The overall probability of smoking is 67%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers is already higher than among smokers when there is no tar deposit (12% vs. 15%). This suggests that there might be an interaction between the unobserved gender and the observed condition of no tar deposit that affects the risk of lung cancer. Additionally, the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with high tar deposit is lower than among smokers with no tar deposit (44% vs. 50%). This further indicates that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not as direct as it might initially appear. The higher probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with no tar deposit compared to smokers with no tar deposit also points to the possibility that the unobserved gender is playing a role in modulating the risk of lung cancer.||",
