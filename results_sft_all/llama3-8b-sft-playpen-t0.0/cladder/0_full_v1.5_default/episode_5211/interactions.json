The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 90%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 44%. For individuals who are male, would it be less likely to see being lactose intolerant if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional condition that being male has a direct effect on department competitiveness and that this, in turn, has a direct effect on being lactose intolerant does not change the direct relationship between being male and the probability of being lactose intolerant. The intervening variable of department competitiveness does not bridge the gap between being male and being less likely to be lactose intolerant, as the direct relationship remains the same.||",
