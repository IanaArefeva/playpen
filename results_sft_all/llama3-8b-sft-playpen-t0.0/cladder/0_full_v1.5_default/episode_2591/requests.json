The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 77%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 26%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 45%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 63%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 37%. The overall probability of smoking is 39%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than among nonsmokers when both groups have a high tar deposit (37% vs. 45%). This suggests that the positive effect of smoking on lung cancer is offset by the negative effect of high tar deposit, which is more likely among nonsmokers.<|eot_id|>",
