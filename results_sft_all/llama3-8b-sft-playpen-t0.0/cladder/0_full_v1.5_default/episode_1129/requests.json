The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 3%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 37%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 64%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 95%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 46%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\n- For patients with small kidney stones, the probability of recovery is 3% without treatment and 37% with treatment. This shows that treatment has a positive effect on recovery for small kidney stones.\n- For patients with large kidney stones, the probability of recovery is 64% without treatment and 95% with treatment. This also shows that treatment has a positive effect on recovery for large kidney stones.\nHowever, the question is whether Will's kidney stone size is large or small. The probability of large kidney stone is 46%, which means that there is a 54% chance that Will's kidney stone is small. If Will's kidney stone is small, then the probability of recovery is 3% without treatment and 37% with treatment. In this case, Will's chance of recovery is higher with treatment than without it.\nOn the other hand, if Will's kidney stone is large, then the probability of recovery is 64% without treatment and 95% with treatment. In this case, Will's chance of recovery is also higher with treatment than without it.\nGiven that the probability of large kidney stone is 46%, we can conclude that the overall probability of Will's chance of recovery is higher with treatment than without",
