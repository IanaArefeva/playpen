The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 19%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 56%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 34%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 68%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 69%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 24%. Does smoking positively affect lactose intolerance through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

To establish whether smoking has a positive effect on lactose intolerance through effort, we need to examine the joint effects of smoking and effort on the probability of being lactose intolerant.\nGiven that the probability of being lactose intolerant is higher for both smokers and hard-working individuals than for both nonsmokers and hard-working individuals, it might appear that there is a positive relationship between smoking and the probability of being lactose intolerant through the intervening variable \"effort\". However, this conclusion is not entirely correct.\nA more rigorous examination of the relationships involved is required. The key insight here is that the joint probability of being a smoker and having a high level of effort is lower than the joint probability of being a nonsmoker and having a high level of effort. This is a critical point, as it directly affects the joint probability of being a smoker and being lactose intolerant.\nTo conclude that there is a positive effect of smoking on the probability of being lactose intolerant through the intervening variable \"effort\", we would need to see that the joint probability of being a smoker and being lactose intolerant is higher than the joint probability of being a nonsmoker and being lactose intolerant. In this case, the joint probability of being a smoker and being lactose intolerant is lower than the joint probability of being a nonsmoker and",
