Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 44%. For people refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 48%. For people getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 69%. Is recovering from the disease more likely than dying from the disease overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
