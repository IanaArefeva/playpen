The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of high rainfall is 48%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of high rainfall is 80%. For days when Alice wakes up late, would it be more likely to see high rainfall if Alice had gotten up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high rainfall is still 80% when she wakes up late, and it remains 48% when she wakes up on time. The condition of whether she woke up late or on time does not change the probability of high rainfall in this scenario.<|eot_id|>",
