The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 39%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 66%. Does education level positively affect salary through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this world, there might be additional, unexplored relationships that link education level to salary without involving skill. For instance, education level could directly influence other skills or assets that are not accounted for in the given relationships, which in turn could lead to higher salaries.
