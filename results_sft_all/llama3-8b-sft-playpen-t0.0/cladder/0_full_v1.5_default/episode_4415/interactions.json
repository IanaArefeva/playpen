The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 44%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 44%. For smokers, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 50%. Is being allergic to peanuts more likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between tar deposit and peanut allergy is that the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher for those with higher tar deposit. Since the probability of being a smoker is 44%, and the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, we can conclude that the overall probability of being allergic to peanuts is less than 50%.||",
