The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 47%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 89%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 6%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 63%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 61%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 38%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect lactose intolerance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being lactose intolerant is higher for women (47% and 89%) than for men (6% and 63%) in both competitive and non-competitive departments, which suggests that being a woman is associated with a higher risk of being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
