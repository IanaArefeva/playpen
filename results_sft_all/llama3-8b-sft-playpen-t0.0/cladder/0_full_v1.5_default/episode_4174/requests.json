The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 6%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 20%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 88%. The overall probability of male gender is 60%. For patients who have a brother, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of having a brother is higher for male patients, the fraction of male patients in the \"with a brother\" group is larger than the fraction of male patients in the \"without a brother\" group. This means that the \"with a brother\" group is more likely to contain male patients, who have a higher probability of recovery (71% for male patients without a brother and 88% for male patients with a brother). In the \"with a brother\" group, the fraction of male patients is larger than the fraction of male patients in the \"without a brother\" group, which means that the \"with a brother\" group is more likely to contain male patients who have a higher probability of recovery.<|eot_id|>",
