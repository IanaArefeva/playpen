Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 6%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 20%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 88%. The overall probability of male gender is 60%.
