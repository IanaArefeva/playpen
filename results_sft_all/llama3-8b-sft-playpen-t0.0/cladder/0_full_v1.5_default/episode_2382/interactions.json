The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 78%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 65%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 74%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 26%. Will increased supply decrease the chance of increased price?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of an increase in price is higher when yield per acre is reduced (78%) than when it is increased (65%). This suggests that a reduction in yield per acre leads to higher demand, which in turn leads to higher prices. In contrast, an increase in yield per acre leads to higher supply, which in turn leads to lower prices. Since the probability of an increase in price is higher when yield per acre is reduced, it is likely that an increase in supply will lead to a decrease in the chance of an increase in price.||",
