Effort has a direct effect on freckles. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 48%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 71%. Will smoking decrease the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of effort on freckles is also an increase in the probability of freckles, which further supports the idea that higher levels of effort lead to higher probabilities of freckles. Since both smoking and effort lead to higher probabilities of freckles, it is not correct to conclude that smoking would decrease the chance of freckles.<|eot_id|>",
