Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. We know that alarm set by husband causes alarm set by wife. alarm set by husband or alarm set by wife causes ringing alarm. Would the alarm rings the next morning if alarm set by husband instead of alarm not set by husband?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
