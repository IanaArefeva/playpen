Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. Will listening to jazz increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer is higher for those who listen to jazz than for those who do not, but this does not imply a direct relationship between the two. The higher probability of lung cancer among those who listen to jazz could be due to the direct relationship between smoke and lung cancer, rather than any direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
