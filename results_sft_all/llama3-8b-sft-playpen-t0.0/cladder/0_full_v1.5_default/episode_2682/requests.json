Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 68%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For people with smoking genes, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had a nonsmoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that having a smoking gene actually reduces the likelihood of lung cancer, not the other way around.<|eot_id|>",
