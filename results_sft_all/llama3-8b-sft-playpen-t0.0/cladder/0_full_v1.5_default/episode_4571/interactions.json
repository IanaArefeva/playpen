The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 63%. The probability of not liking spicy food and cholera contraction is 24%. The probability of liking spicy food and cholera contraction is 19%. Is the chance of cholera contraction larger when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The water company's direct effect on liking spicy food further blurs the connection between the two variables. In this context, the probability of cholera contraction is not directly determined by the individual's willingness to consume spicy food, and the additional relationships in the system lead to a more complex interaction between the variables.||",
