Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 68%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 37%.

The only direct relationship we have is that diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Since we do not have any direct relationship between speaking English and diabetes, we need to consider the relationships through other variables. The probability of long lifespan is higher for those who do not speak English (68%) than for those who speak English (37%). This suggests that the direct or indirect effect of speaking English on long lifespan is negative.<|eot_id|>",
