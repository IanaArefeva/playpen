Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 90%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 31%. For husbands that set the alarm, would it be less likely to see ringing alarm if the husband had not set the alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that setting the alarm actually decreases the likelihood of the alarm clock ringing, from 90% to 31%.<|eot_id|>",
