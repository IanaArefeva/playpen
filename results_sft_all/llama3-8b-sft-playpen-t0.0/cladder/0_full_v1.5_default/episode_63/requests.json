The candle has a direct effect on room. For people not blowing out candles, the probability of dark room is 41%. For people who blow out candles, the probability of dark room is 74%. For people who blow out candles, would it be less likely to see dark room if the person in the room had not blown out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a dark room is higher (74%) when the person in the room blows out the candle compared to when they do not (41%). This suggests that the person's action of blowing out the candle is the primary cause of the room being dark. If the person in the room had not blown out the candle, the probability of a dark room would still be lower (41%) compared to the situation where they do blow out the candle (74%).<|eot_id|>",
