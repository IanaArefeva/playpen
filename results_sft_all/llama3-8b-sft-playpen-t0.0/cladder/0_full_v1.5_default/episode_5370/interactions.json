The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on relationship status. Appearance has a direct effect on relationship status. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 94%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of attractive appearance is 97%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of attractive appearance is 97%. Is attractive appearance more likely than unattractive appearance overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the joint probability of liking spicy food and having an attractive appearance is the product of the individual probabilities, which is 0.94 * 0.97 = 0.91. The joint probability of not liking spicy food and having an attractive appearance is 0.06 * 0.97 = 0.0582. The joint probability of not liking spicy food and having an unattractive appearance is 0.06 * 0.03 = 0.0018. The joint probability of liking spicy food and having an unattractive appearance is 0.94 * 0.03 = 0.0282. The joint probability of having an unattractive appearance is the sum of the joint probabilities of not liking spicy food and having an unattractive appearance, and of liking spicy food and having an unattractive appearance, which is 0.0582 + 0.0282 = 0.0864. The joint probability of having an attractive appearance is the sum of the joint probabilities of not liking spicy food and having an attractive appearance, and of liking spicy food and having an attractive appearance, which is 0.0582 + 0.91 = 0.9682.
