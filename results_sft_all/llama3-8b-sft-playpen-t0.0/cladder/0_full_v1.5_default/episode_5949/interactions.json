The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England and director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to fire the employee. Would the employee is fired if not having visited England instead of having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The visit to England is an intervening cause that disrupts the direct relationship between the CEO and the director, leading to the employee being fired. If the CEO's visit to England were absent, the direct relationship between the CEO and the director would still lead to the director signing the termination letter, and the employee would be fired.||",
