The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 27%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 65%. For people who have a brother, would it be more likely to see high salary if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the positive effect of having a brother on salary is entirely mediated through the increase in skill. If we condition on not having a brother, we are removing the direct cause of higher skill, and the subsequent positive effect on salary. In this case, the probability of high salary is 27%, which is the same as for people who do not have a brother. This suggests that the positive effect of having a brother on salary is entirely due to the increase in skill, and that there is no direct positive effect of having a brother on salary that is not mediated through skill.||",
