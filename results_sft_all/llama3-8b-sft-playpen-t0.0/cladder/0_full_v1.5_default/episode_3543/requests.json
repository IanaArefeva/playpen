The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 39%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 46%. For people who have a brother, would it be more likely to see smallpox survival if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between having a brother and vaccination reaction is also positive, meaning that having a brother is associated with a more positive vaccination reaction. Since a more positive vaccination reaction is associated with higher smallpox survival, and having a brother is associated with both a more positive vaccination reaction and higher smallpox survival, it is not more likely to see smallpox survival if the person did not have a brother.<|eot_id|>",
