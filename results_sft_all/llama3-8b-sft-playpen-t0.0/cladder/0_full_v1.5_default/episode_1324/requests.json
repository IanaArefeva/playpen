The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 48%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 78%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 25%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 25%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 59%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 61%. The overall probability of high pollution is 54%. Does gene negatively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The gene affects the probability of smoking, which in turn affects the probability of lung cancer. The direct relationship between the gene and lung cancer is not established in the given conditions.<|eot_id|>",
