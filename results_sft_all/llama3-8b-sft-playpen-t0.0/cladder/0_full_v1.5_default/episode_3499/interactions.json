The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and foot size. Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 64%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of large feet is 53%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of large feet is 45%. Is large feet less likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of large feet is higher for those who take the stairs (53%) than for those who take the elevator (45%). Since the probability of taking the stairs is lower than the probability of taking the elevator (36% vs 64%), the overall probability of large feet is still higher than the probability of small feet.||",
