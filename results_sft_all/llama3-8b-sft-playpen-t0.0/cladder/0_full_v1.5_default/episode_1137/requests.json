Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 49%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 53%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 38%.

Since the probability of not receiving treatment is 51% (100% - 49%), we can calculate the overall probability of recovery as follows: (0.38 * 0.49) + (0.53 * 0.51) = 0.18522 + 0.27093 = 0.45615. The probability of non-recovery is 1 - 0.45615 = 0.54385. Since 0.45615 is less than 0.54385, we conclude that non-recovery is more likely than recovery overall.<|eot_id|>",
