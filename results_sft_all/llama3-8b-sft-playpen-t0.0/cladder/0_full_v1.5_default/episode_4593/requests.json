Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 77%. For people who have a brother, the probability of ringing alarm is 25%. Will having a brother increase the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is higher for people who do not have a brother (77%) than for those who have a brother (25%). This suggests that having a brother might actually decrease the chance of the alarm clock ringing, rather than increase it.<|eot_id|>",
