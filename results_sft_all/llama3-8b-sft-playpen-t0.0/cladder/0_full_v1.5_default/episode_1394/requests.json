The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 18%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 74%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer for smokers is 74%, and the probability of absence of lung cancer for smokers is 26%. Since the probability of absence of lung cancer is higher than the probability of lung cancer for both groups, and the overall probability of smoking is 18%, the overall probability of absence of lung cancer is higher than the probability of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
