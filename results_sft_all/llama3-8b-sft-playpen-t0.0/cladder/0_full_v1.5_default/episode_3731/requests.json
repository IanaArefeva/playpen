The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drinking coffee and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 55%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 71%. For people living far from a college, the probability of drinking coffee is 36%. For people living close to a college, the probability of drinking coffee is 88%. Will drinking coffee increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key issue is the potential confounding effect of unobserved variables. Since we have a direct link between unobserved confounders and both coffee consumption and salary, we must consider the possibility that unobserved confounders could be driving the association between coffee consumption and higher salary. If unobserved confounders are indeed the primary cause of higher salary, then the observed relationship between coffee consumption and higher salary could be spurious. In this case, we would conclude that coffee consumption does not increase the chance of a high salary.<|eot_id|>",
