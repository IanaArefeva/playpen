Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 34%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 37%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 68%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 65%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 4%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 9%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 79%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 56%. The overall probability of confounder active is 47%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?",
