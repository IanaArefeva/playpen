The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. We know that smoking mother or good health causes normal infant birth weight. smoking mother and good health and normal infant birth weight causes high infant mortality. We observed the person has poor health. Would infant mortality is high if nonsmoking mother instead of smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that the person has poor health, this condition likely exerts a strong effect on birth weight and, through that, on infant mortality. The additional information that the person is a nonsmoking mother does not change the fact that they have poor health, which is the primary driver of the observed birth weight and subsequent infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
