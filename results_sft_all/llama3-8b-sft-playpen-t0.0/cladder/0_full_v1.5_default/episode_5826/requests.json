The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of having a brother is 90%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 55%. For people who have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 65%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer is also directly affected by the unobserved condition of pollution. Since we do not have direct information about the relationship between pollution and lung cancer, we must consider the joint effects of having a brother and the unobserved condition of pollution on the overall probability of lung cancer.\nGiven that the probability of having a brother is 90%, and that having a brother directly affects the probability of lung cancer, we can conclude that the joint probability of having a brother and lung cancer is higher than the joint probability of not having a brother and lung cancer.\nHowever, we also need to consider the direct effect of the unobserved condition of pollution on the probability of lung cancer.
