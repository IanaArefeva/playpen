The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 55%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 47%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 13%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 7%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 77%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 54%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 43%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 20%. The overall probability of confounder active is 48%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would parents' intelligence negatively affect child's intelligence?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
