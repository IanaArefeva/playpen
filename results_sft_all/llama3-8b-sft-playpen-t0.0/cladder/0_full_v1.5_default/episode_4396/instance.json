Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 19%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 70%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 45%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 70%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 32%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 59%. The overall probability of smoking is 48%. Does smoking positively affect peanut allergy through tar deposit?",
