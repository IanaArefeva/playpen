The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of having a sister is 13%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 28%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 54%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 87% of the population does not have a sister, and among them, 28% have lung cancer. The remaining 13% have a sister, and among them, 54% have lung cancer. To find the overall probability of lung cancer, we need to consider both groups. The probability of lung cancer for those without a sister is 0.27 (28% of 87% is 0.2414, but we round to 0.27 for simplicity), and the probability of lung cancer for those with a sister is 0.54. The overall probability of lung cancer is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is (0.27 * 0.87) + (0.54 * 0.13) = 0.2349. Since this is less than 0.5, the absence of lung cancer is more likely than lung cancer overall.||",
