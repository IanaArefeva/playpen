The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 32%. The probability of manager not signing the termination letter and employee being fired is 16%. The probability of manager signing the termination letter and employee being fired is 21%. Is the chance of employee being fired smaller when observing manager signing the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since 16% is less than 21%, the chance of the employee being fired is larger when the manager signs the termination letter.<|eot_id|>",
