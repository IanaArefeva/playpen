The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 10%. The probability of absence of citrus and curly hair is 50%. The probability of citrus intake and curly hair is 4%. Is the chance of curly hair larger when observing citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key point is that the probability of citrus intake and curly hair is 4%, which is lower than the probability of absence of citrus and curly hair (50%). This suggests that the joint occurrence of citrus and curly hair is not more likely than the joint absence of both.||",
