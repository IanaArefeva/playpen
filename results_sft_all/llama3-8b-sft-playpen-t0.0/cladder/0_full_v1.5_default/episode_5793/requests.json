The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 75%. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 26%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 58%. Is freckles more likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of smoking is 75%, this means that a large majority of the population is likely to have higher probability of freckles than those who are not smoking. The specific numbers of 26% and 58% for the probability of freckles among nonsmokers and smokers, respectively, further support this conclusion.<|eot_id|>",
