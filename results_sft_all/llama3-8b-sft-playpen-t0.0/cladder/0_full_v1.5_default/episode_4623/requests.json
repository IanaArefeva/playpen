The candle has a direct effect on room. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 88%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 57%. For people who drink coffee, would it be less likely to see dark room if the person did not drink coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of dark room is determined by the interaction between the person's coffee consumption and the direct effect of the candle on room. Since the direct effect of the candle on room is not dependent on the person's coffee consumption, the probability of dark room remains the same whether the person drinks coffee or not.<|eot_id|>",
