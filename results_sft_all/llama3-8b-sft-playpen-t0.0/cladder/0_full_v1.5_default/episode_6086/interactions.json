The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. We know that male gender causes non-competitive department. male gender and competitive department causes being allergic to peanuts. Would the applicant is not allergic to peanuts if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between department competitiveness and being allergic to peanuts further solidifies the connection between male gender and being allergic to peanuts. If we consider a different condition where the individual is not male, we must account for the potential shift in department competitiveness and its subsequent effect on being allergic to peanuts. In this case, the absence of male gender could lead to a more competitive department, which in turn could lead to being allergic to peanuts. This chain of cause and effect still places the individual at risk of being allergic to peanuts, even if they are not male.||",
