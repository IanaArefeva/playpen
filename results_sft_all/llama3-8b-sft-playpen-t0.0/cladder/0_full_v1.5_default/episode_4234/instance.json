Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 4%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 36%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 64%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 97%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 40%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see thick lips if the patient had received no treatment?",
