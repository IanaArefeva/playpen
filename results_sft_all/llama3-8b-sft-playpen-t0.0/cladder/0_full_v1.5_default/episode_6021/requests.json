Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. We know that taking the elevator causes penguin saddness. taking the elevator and penguin happiness causes large feet.

Since taking the stairs instead of the elevator would lead to a positive penguin mood (as it counteracts the cause of penguin saddness), it would imply that my decision is positive and foot size is large.<|eot_id|>",
