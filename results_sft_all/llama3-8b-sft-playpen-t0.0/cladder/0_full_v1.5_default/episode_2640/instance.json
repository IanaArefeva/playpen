Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 85%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 11%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 75%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 35%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 74%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 36%. The overall probability of smoking is 53%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?",
