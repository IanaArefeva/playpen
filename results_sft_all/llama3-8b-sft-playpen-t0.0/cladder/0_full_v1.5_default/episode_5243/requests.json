Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 58%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 45%. Will male gender decrease the chance of being lactose intolerant?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, the direct relationship between male gender and lower probability of being lactose intolerant is offset by the direct relationship between male gender and higher department competitiveness, which in turn directly affects the probability of being lactose intolerant. Since the direct relationship between male gender and lower probability of being lactose intolerant is counteracted by the direct relationship between male gender and higher department competitiveness, which likely exerts a positive effect on the probability of being lactose intolerant, male gender does not decrease the chance of being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
