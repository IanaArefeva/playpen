Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 62%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 45%. For people who have a sister, would it be less likely to see healthy heart if the person did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between blood pressure and heart condition is that higher blood pressure is associated with a lower probability of a healthy heart. Since having a sister is not directly related to blood pressure, and the relationship between having a sister and heart condition is already accounted for, we can conclude that the probability of a healthy heart for someone who has a sister is not less likely than for someone who does not have a sister.<|eot_id|>",
