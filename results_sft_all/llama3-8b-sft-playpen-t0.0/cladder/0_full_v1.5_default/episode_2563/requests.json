The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 85%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 76%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 56%. Is high infant mortality more likely than low infant mortality overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The higher probability of high infant mortality among non-smoking mothers (76%) compared to smoking mothers (56%) further suggests that the health condition, which is unobserved, exerts a more significant influence on infant mortality than the direct effect of maternal smoking. This indicates that the overall probability of high infant mortality is likely lower than that of low infant mortality, given the higher birth weight and lower direct risk associated with non-smoking mothers.<|eot_id|>",
