Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 68%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 79%.

Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for nonsmokers than for smokers, it suggests that the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is offset by the intervening effect of tar deposit, which likely exerts a negative influence on the risk of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
