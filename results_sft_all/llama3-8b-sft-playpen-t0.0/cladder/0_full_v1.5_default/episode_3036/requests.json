Since we already know that the patient is young and that young age is associated with lower hospital costs, we can conclude that the patient's hospital costs will be lower than those of older patients. In this case, the lower hospital costs will not lead to higher chances of recovery, as the direct relationship between hospital costs and recovery is that higher hospital costs lead to higher chances of recovery.<|eot_id|>",
