Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 53%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 69%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, and this higher probability is not directly due to the person's current smoking habits but rather the long-term effects of past smoking habits, we can conclude that the person's current smoking habits do not directly reduce the likelihood of lung cancer. In other words, the person's current smoking habits do not counteract the higher risk of lung cancer associated with past smoking habits.<|eot_id|>",
