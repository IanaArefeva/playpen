Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. We know that having a brother causes having smallpox and no vaccine reaction. having smallpox or severe vaccination reaction causes smallpox survival. Would the person dies from smallpox if not having a brother instead of having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between having a brother and smallpox survival is through the intermediate step of having smallpox and a vaccine reaction. If the person does not have a brother, they will not have smallpox, and without smallpox, they will not have a vaccine reaction. Since having a vaccine reaction is a direct cause of smallpox survival, the absence of a vaccine reaction means that the person will not survive smallpox.<|eot_id|>",
