The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 97%. The probability of absence of citrus and curly hair is 2%. The probability of citrus intake and curly hair is 37%. Is the chance of curly hair larger when observing citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the probability of citrus and curly hair is less than the probability of citrus, which is a sign of negative association between citrus and curly hair. In other words, the chance of curly hair is lower when observing citrus intake.<|eot_id|>",
