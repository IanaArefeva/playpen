The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 56%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 32%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 76%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 43%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 67%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 32%. The overall probability of smoking is 37%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with no tar deposit is 76%, which is higher than the probability of lung cancer among smokers with no tar deposit (67%). This suggests that the absence of tar deposit may be a more significant risk factor for lung cancer than smoking. Additionally, the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with high tar deposit is 43%, which is lower than the probability of lung cancer among smokers with high tar deposit (32%). This further indicates that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not as direct as it initially appears.<|eot_id|>",
