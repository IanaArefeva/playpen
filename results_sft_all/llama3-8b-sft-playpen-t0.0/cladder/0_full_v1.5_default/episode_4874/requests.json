Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 6%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 44%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 5%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The difference in probability is 39%, which is larger than the difference in the probability of waking up on time (44% - 6% = 38%). This suggests that the chance of high rainfall is larger when Alice wakes up late, not smaller.<|eot_id|>",
