The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to retain the employee. Would the employee is fired if having visited England instead of not having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that the CEO's decision to fire the employee causes having visited England and director signing the termination letter, and we also know that the CEO's decision to fire the employee is not being made (since the CEO decides to retain the employee), we can conclude that having visited England would not lead to the director signing the termination letter, and therefore would not lead to the employee being fired.||",
