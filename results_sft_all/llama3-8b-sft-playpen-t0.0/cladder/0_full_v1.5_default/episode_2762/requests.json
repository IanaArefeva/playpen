The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 34%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 12%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 52%. Is normal infant birth weight more likely than low infant birth weight overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of a mother being a smoker is 34%, we can use this information to calculate the overall probability of normal birth weight. The probability of a normal birth weight for an infant with a smoking mother is 0.34 * 0.52 = 0.1772, and the probability of a normal birth weight for an infant with a nonsmoking mother is 0.66 * 0.12 = 0.0792. The total probability of a normal birth weight is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.1772 + 0.0792 = 0.2564. The probability of a normal birth weight is less than 0.5, which means that normal birth weight is not more likely than low birth weight overall.<|eot_id|>",
