Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 98%. The probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 1%. The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 57%.

Since the probability of diabetes is higher in the case of obesity (98% vs. 1%), the net effect of obesity on lifespan is likely to be negative. This is confirmed by the fact that the probability of long lifespan is lower in the case of obesity (57% vs. 1%).<|eot_id|>",
