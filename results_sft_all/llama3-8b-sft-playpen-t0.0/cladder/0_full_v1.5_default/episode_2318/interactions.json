The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 98%. The probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 1%. The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 57%. Is the chance of long lifespan larger when observing obesity?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of diabetes is higher in the case of obesity (98% vs. 1%), the net effect of obesity on lifespan is likely to be negative. This is confirmed by the fact that the probability of long lifespan is lower in the case of obesity (57% vs. 1%).||",
