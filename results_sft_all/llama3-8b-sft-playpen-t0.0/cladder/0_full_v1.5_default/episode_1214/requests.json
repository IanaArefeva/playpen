The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 46%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 80%. For infants with smoking mothers, would it be more likely to see high infant mortality if the infant had a nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The health condition is unobserved, and its direct effects on birth weight and infant mortality are not dependent on the maternal smoking status. The birth weight, in turn, has a direct effect on infant mortality. The probability of high infant mortality for an infant with a smoking mother is 80%, which is higher than the 46% probability for an infant with a nonsmoking mother. This difference in probability directly results from the direct effect of maternal smoking on birth weight and subsequent infant mortality, rather than any interaction between the health condition and the maternal smoking status.<|eot_id|>",
