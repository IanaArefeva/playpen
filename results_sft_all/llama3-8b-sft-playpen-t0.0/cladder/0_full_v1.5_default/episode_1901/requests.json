Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 93%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 80%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 80%. Is talent more likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being unattractive is only 7% (100% - 93%), the overall probability of having talent is still predominantly determined by the large number of attractive people, who have an 80% chance of having talent. This means that the overall probability of having talent is still higher than the probability of lacking talent, which is 20% (100% - 80%).<|eot_id|>",
