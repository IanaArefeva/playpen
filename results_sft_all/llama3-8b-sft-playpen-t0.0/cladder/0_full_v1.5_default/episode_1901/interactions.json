The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 93%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 80%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 80%. Is talent more likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of being unattractive is only 7% (100% - 93%), the overall probability of having talent is still predominantly determined by the large number of attractive people, who have an 80% chance of having talent. This means that the overall probability of having talent is still higher than the probability of lacking talent, which is 20% (100% - 80%).||",
