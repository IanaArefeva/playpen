Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. We know that full moon causes rain and sprinkler on. rain and sprinkler on causes wet ground. Would the ground is dry if full moon instead of no full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of full moon on rain supersedes the direct effect of no full moon on rain, and the direct effect of rain on ground supersedes the direct effect of no full moon on ground. Since the ground is already known to be wet under the condition of full moon, it remains wet under the condition of full moon.<|eot_id|>",
