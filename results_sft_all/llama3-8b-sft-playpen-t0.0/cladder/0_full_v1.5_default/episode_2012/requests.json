The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 50%. The probability of high school degree or lower and high salary is 30%. The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 7%. Is the chance of high salary smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The unobserved confounder has a direct effect on both education level and salary, which means that the relationship between college degree and high salary is likely being influenced by this unseen variable. In other words, the positive relationship between college degree and high salary might be spurious, meaning that it's not really a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but rather a result of the unobserved confounder's influence on both education and salary.<|eot_id|>",
