Effort has a direct effect on college admission. Method 1: We look directly at how smoking correlates with college admission in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to effort. To understand how smoking affects college admission, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this carefully designed world, the direct relationship between smoking and college admission is only fully accounted for when we condition on the intervening variable of effort. If we look at the general relationship between smoking and college admission without controlling for effort, we risk misestimating the direct effect of smoking on college admission. This is because the general relationship between smoking and college admission is likely to be confounded by the intervening variable of effort, which is also directly related to college admission. In other words, the general relationship between smoking and college admission is not a direct relationship, but rather a relationship that is partially accounted for by the intervening variable of effort. To get an accurate measure of the direct effect of smoking on college admission, we need to condition on the intervening variable of effort, which is exactly what Method 2 does.<|eot_id|>",
