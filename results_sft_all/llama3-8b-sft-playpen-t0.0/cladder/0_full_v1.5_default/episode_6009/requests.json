Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that solar eclipse and heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is no traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if no solar eclipse instead of solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that there is no traffic on the road, the absence of solar eclipse would not change the road condition. In this isolated system, the direct cause of Alice's late arrival is the solar eclipse, and removing the solar eclipse would likely lead to Alice's on-time arrival.<|eot_id|>",
