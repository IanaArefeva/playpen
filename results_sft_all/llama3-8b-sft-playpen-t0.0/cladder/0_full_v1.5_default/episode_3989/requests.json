Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 35%. For children who like spicy food, the probability of intelligent child is 75%.

The direct effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence is also positive, which means that higher social status parents are likely to have more intelligent children. Since the direct effect of liking spicy food on child's intelligence is positive and separate from the direct effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence, we can conclude that liking spicy food will not decrease the chance of an intelligent child.<|eot_id|>",
