The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 94%. For patients who have small kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 80%. For patients who have large kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 18%. For patients who have large kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 5%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 58%. For patients who speak english, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When we condition on the patient speaking English, we are focusing on a specific subpopulation that already has a higher likelihood of large kidney stones (58% vs. 42% for small kidney stones). In this subpopulation, the probability of recovery is already very low (5% for large kidney stones and English speakers), and the additional condition of not speaking English does not further reduce this already low probability. In fact, the probability of large kidney stone is higher in the subpopulation that does not speak English (58% vs. 42% for English speakers), which means that the condition of not speaking English is associated with a higher likelihood of large kidney stone, and by extension, a lower likelihood of recovery.<|eot_id|>",
