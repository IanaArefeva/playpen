Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. We know that obesity and smoker causes having diabetes. obesity or smoker or having diabetes causes long lifespan. We observed the person is a nonsmoker.

Since we also know that obesity and having diabetes are direct causes of short lifespan, and the person is a nonsmoker, we can conclude that the person's short lifespan is likely due to having diabetes rather than being obese. If the person were normal weight instead of obese, we still can't conclude that they would have a long lifespan, since we already know that having diabetes is a direct cause of short lifespan, and we have no information about the person's diabetes status.<|eot_id|>",
