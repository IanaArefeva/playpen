The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and freckles. Effort has a direct effect on freckles. Method 1: We look at how smoking correlates with freckles case by case according to effort. Method 2: We look directly at how smoking correlates with freckles in general. To understand how smoking affects freckles, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key point here is that the direct relationship between smoking and freckles is not being confounded by the intervening variable \"effort\". In other words, the direct relationship between smoking and freckles is not being \"mediated\" by the intervening variable \"effort\". In this case, looking at the direct relationship between smoking and freckles in general (Method 2) is a more correct and direct way to understand how smoking affects freckles, rather than looking at the relationship through the intervening variable \"effort\" (Method 1).||",
