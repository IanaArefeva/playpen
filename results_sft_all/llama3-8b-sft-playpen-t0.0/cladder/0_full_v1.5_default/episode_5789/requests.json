The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 82%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 56%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 79%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 53%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 66%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 32%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see freckles if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high tar deposit for a smoker is 32%. This means that the probability of having both high tar deposit and being a smoker is 0.32. The probability of having no tar deposit and being a smoker is 0.68. The probability of having no tar deposit and being a smoker and having freckles is 0.68 * 0.79 = 0.5372. The probability of having high tar deposit and being a smoker and having freckles is 0.32 * 0.53 = 0.1704. Since 0.5372 is greater than 0.1704, it is more likely to see freckles if the person had been a nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
