Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 82%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 56%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 79%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 53%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 66%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 32%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see freckles if the person had been a nonsmoker?",
