The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 55%. For people without a college degree, the probability of large feet is 46%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of large feet is 8%. Is large feet less likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of having a college degree or higher is 55%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction: (0.55 * 0.08) + (0.45 * 0.46) = 0.044 + 0.207 = 0.251. The probability of having large feet is higher than the probability of having small feet (0.251  0.749), so large feet are more likely than small feet overall.||",
