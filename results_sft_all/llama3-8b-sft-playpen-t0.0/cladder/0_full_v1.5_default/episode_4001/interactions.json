The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 19%. For children who do not like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 14%. For children who like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 57%. For children who like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 46%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 59%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 45%. For children who like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 27%. For children who like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 60%. The overall probability of confounder active is 55%. Does liking spicy food negatively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence is positive, as children with higher social status parents are more likely to be intelligent. Liking spicy food has a positive effect on child's intelligence through parents' social status, as children who like spicy food and have higher social status parents are more likely to be intelligent. The positive effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence is not offset by the negative effect of liking spicy food, as the overall probability of intelligent child is higher for children who like spicy food than for those who do not.||",
