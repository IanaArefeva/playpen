The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 99%. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 49%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 60%. Is long lifespan less likely than short lifespan overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is also negative. Since the probability of long lifespan is higher for obese people than for normal weight people (60% vs 49%), and the direct relationship between obesity and long lifespan is positive, we can conclude that long lifespan is more likely than short lifespan overall.<|eot_id|>",
