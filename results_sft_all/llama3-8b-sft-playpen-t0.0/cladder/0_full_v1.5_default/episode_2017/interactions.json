The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 49%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 57%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 30%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of college degree or higher on high salary is not quantified in the given information, and we must consider the potential confounding effects of the unobserved variables. The differences in probability of high salary between those living far and close to a college (39% vs. 49%) and those living far and close to a college (57% vs. 30%) do not directly imply a positive relationship between college degree or higher and high salary. In fact, the lower probability of college degree or higher among those living close to a college (30%) compared to those living far from a college (57%) might indicate that the positive relationship between college degree or higher and high salary is offset by the negative confounding effect of the unobserved variables.||",
