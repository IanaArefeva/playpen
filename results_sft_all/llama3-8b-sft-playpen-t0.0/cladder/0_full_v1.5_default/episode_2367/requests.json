Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 6%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 54%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 36%. Is scurvy less likely than no scurvy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of citrus consumption is 6%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction to find the overall probability of scurvy: (0.06) * 36% + (0.94) * 54% = 4.16% + 50.76% = 54.92%. This is higher than the probability of no scurvy, which is 100% - 54.92% = 45.08%.<|eot_id|>",
