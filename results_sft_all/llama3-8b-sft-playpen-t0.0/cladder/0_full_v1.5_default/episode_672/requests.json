The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 13%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 73%. For students who are encouraged, would it be less likely to see high exam score if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the absence of encouragement, a student's exam score is still subject to the direct effect of their studying habits. Since the probability of a high exam score is 13% for students who are not encouraged, and 73% for students who are encouraged, this difference in exam score probability directly results from the encouragement level, not from the studying habits. If a student who is encouraged still does not study well, their exam score will likely be lower than that of an encouraged student who studies well, but this does not imply that the exam score of an unencouraged student would be lower than that of an unencouraged student who studies well.<|eot_id|>",
