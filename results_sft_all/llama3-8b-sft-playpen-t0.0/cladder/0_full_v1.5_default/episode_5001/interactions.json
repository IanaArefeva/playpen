The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of having a sister is 6%. The probability of not having a sister and healthy heart is 75%. The probability of having a sister and healthy heart is 1%. Is the chance of healthy heart larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having a sister and a heart condition is 1.5% (6% chance of having a sister and 25% chance of heart condition), which is higher than the 1% chance of having a sister and a heart condition. This suggests that having a sister has a direct positive effect on heart condition, which is not fully offset by the direct negative effect of blood pressure on heart condition.||",
