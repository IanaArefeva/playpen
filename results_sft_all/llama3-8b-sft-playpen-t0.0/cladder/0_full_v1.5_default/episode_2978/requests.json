The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that intelligent parents or confounder active causes high parental social status. intelligent parents and confounder active and high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder active. Would the child is not intelligent if intelligent parents instead of unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that intelligent parents lead to high social status, and that high social status leads to intelligent children, we can conclude that intelligent parents will still lead to intelligent children, even if we control for the active confounder. The direct link between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence remains intact, so the child will still be intelligent if intelligent parents are involved, rather than unintelligent parents.<|eot_id|>",
