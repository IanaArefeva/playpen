The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 40%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 67%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 13%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 42%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 52%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 11%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 73%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 44%. The overall probability of good health is 19%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would having a sister negatively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The table only provides the probability of normal birth weight for different subgroups, which does not directly imply a negative relationship between having a sister and infant's birth weight. The table does not provide any direct information about the relationship between having a sister and infant's birth weight, so we cannot conclude that having a sister would lead to lower birth weight and higher infant mortality.||",
