The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 40%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 67%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 13%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 42%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 52%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 11%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 73%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 44%. The overall probability of good health is 19%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would having a sister negatively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The table only provides the probability of normal birth weight for different subgroups, which does not directly imply a negative relationship between having a sister and infant's birth weight. The table does not provide any direct information about the relationship between having a sister and infant's birth weight, so we cannot conclude that having a sister would lead to lower birth weight and higher infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
