The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of having visited England is 43%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 18%. For people who have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 66%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of having visited England is 0.43, we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of an individual being fired: 0.66 * 0.43 + 0.18 * 0.57 = 0.2834. The probability of an individual not being fired is 1 - 0.2834 = 0.7166, which is higher than the probability of being fired.<|eot_id|>",
