The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 61%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 31%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 67%. Is employee being fired less likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
