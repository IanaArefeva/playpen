The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on skin. Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 42%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 90%. For people who went to tanning salons, would it be less likely to see tanned skin if the person had not had a tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of tanned skin is 90% for people who went to tanning salons, which is higher than the 42% probability for those who haven't used tanning salon treatments. This indicates that tanning salon treatment directly affects skin, making it more likely to be tanned. The beach visit also directly affects skin, but its separate direct effect doesn't reduce the tanning probability when someone has already used tanning salon treatments.||",
