Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 90%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 25%.

This is because setting the alarm directly counteracts the wife's effect on the alarm, which is to ring it. The husband's action of setting the alarm directly affects the probability of the alarm ringing, but in a negative way.<|eot_id|>",
