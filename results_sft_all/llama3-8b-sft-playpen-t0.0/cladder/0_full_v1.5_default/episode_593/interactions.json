The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 55%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 87%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be less likely to see high salary if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this world, having a college degree directly affects one's skill, which in turn affects one's salary. The probability of high salary is higher for those with a college degree (87%) than for those without (55%). This suggests that the college degree exerts its positive effect on salary through the skill variable. If we condition on having a college degree, the skill level is likely to be higher, which in turn leads to a higher probability of high salary. The absence of a college degree does not directly reduce the probability of high salary; rather, it would reduce the probability of having the necessary skill to achieve a high salary.||",
