The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who do not like spicy food, the probability of high salary is 38%. For individuals who like spicy food, the probability of high salary is 48%. For individuals who like spicy food, would it be less likely to see high salary if the individual did not like spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In other words, the absence of \"liking spicy food\" does not directly reduce the likelihood of \"high salary\" in this world.||",
