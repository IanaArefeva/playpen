The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of clean water is 40%. The probability of polluted water and cholera contraction is 37%. The probability of clean water and cholera contraction is 34%. Is the chance of cholera contraction larger when observing clean water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the water company's behavior can counteract the positive effect of clean water on the risk of cholera. In this context, the chance of cholera contraction is not larger when observing clean water, as the water company's activities can still lead to a higher risk of cholera, even in the presence of clean water.||",
