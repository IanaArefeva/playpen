The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes manager signing the termination letter and director signing the termination letter. manager signing the termination letter and director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to retain the employee. Would the employee is not fired if manager not signing the termination letter instead of manager signing the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The chain of causality is as follows: CEO decision (retain) - manager (not sign) and director (not sign) - manager and director do not sign the termination letter, which in turn does not lead to the manager and director's actions of signing the letter, and finally, the absence of the manager and director's actions of signing the letter means the employee is not fired.||",
