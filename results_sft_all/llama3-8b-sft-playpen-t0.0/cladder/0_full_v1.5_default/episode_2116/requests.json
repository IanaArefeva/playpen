Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 74%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 21%. Will male gender increase the chance of admission acceptance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of male gender on department competitiveness is not quantified, but it is likely that male gender would increase department competitiveness, which in turn would reduce the chance of admission acceptance. Since the direct effect of male gender on admission acceptance is lower than the direct effect of not being male, and the direct effect of male gender on department competitiveness is likely to reduce the chance of admission acceptance, male gender would not increase the chance of admission acceptance.<|eot_id|>",
