The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 48%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 57%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 74%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 41%. Will smoking mother decrease the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of normal birth weight is higher in areas with high cigarette tax (57%) than in areas with low cigarette tax (48%). This suggests that the cigarette tax has a positive effect on birth weight, likely through its effect on maternal smoking behavior. Since the cigarette tax directly affects maternal smoking behavior, which in turn affects birth weight, we can conclude that the positive effect of the cigarette tax on birth weight is likely due to its reduction of maternal smoking. If we control for the cigarette tax, we would still see a direct positive relationship between normal birth weight and the probability of a smoking mother, as the cigarette tax is the primary driver of this relationship.<|eot_id|>",
