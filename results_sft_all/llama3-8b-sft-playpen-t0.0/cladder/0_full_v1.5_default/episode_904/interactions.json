The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 66%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 36%. Will smoking decrease the chance of college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, the direct effect of smoking on college admission is not the only relevant relationship here. The direct effect of effort on college admission is also positive, and this relationship is not subject to the same negative bias as the direct relationship between smoking and college admission. In this world, the positive direct effect of effort on college admission likely counteracts the negative direct effect of smoking on college admission, leading to a net positive relationship between smoking and college admission.||",
