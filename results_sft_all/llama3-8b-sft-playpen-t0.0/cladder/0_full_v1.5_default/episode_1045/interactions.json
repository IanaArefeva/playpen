The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how supply correlates with price in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to demand. To understand how supply affects price, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the absence of direct demand measurement, looking at the general correlation between supply and price (Method 1) would likely lead to spurious conclusions about the relationship between supply and price, as demand could be driving both supply and price movements. In contrast, looking at the relationship between supply and price on a case-by-case basis according to demand (Method 2) would control for demand's effects and provide a more accurate picture of how supply affects price.||",
