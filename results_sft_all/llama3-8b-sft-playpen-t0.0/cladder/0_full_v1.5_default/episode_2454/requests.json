The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 96%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 74%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 24%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 2%. The overall probability of old age is 40%. Will high hospital bill decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The interaction between age and hospital costs also exerts a strong influence on the probability of recovery. In particular, for both young and old patients, a high hospital bill is associated with a lower probability of recovery. This suggests that the negative effect of a high hospital bill on recovery is not unique to any particular age group, but rather a general property of the relationship between hospital costs and recovery.<|eot_id|>",
