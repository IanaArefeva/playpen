The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes manager not signing the termination letter and director signing the termination letter. manager signing the termination letter or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to fire the employee. Would the employee is not fired if manager not signing the termination letter instead of manager signing the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The CEO's decision to fire the employee directly affects the manager and the director, leading them to sign the termination letter. The manager's and the director's separate direct effects on the employee then lead to the employee being fired. If the manager does not sign the termination letter, it would still lead to the director signing the letter, and the director's action would still lead to the employee being fired. The manager's action is not a necessary condition for the employee being fired; the director's action is.<|eot_id|>",
