The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. We know that male gender and high skill level causes white-collar job. male gender or high skill level or white-collar job causes high salary. We observed the person has a low skill level. Would the employee has a high salary if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the person has a male gender, this direct effect is active. The direct effect of male gender on white-collar job and the direct effect of white-collar job on high salary imply that male gender is a cause of high salary. The person's male gender is the active cause of their white-collar job, which in turn is the active cause of their high salary. If the person's gender were non-male, this direct effect would be absent, and the person's white-collar job and high salary would not be caused by their male gender. The person's white-collar job is still a direct cause of their high salary, and the person's male gender is still a direct cause of their white-collar job. If the person's male gender were absent, the person's white-collar job and high salary would not be caused by their male gender, and the person's white-collar job and high salary would still be direct causes of each other. The person's white-collar job is a direct cause of their high salary, and the person's male gender is a direct cause of their white-collar job.
