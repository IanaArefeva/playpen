The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of having a sister is 98%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 24%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 48%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the vast majority of the population (98%) has a sister, and among this large group, the probability of lung cancer is still only 48%. In contrast, the probability of lung cancer among those without a sister is 24%. Since the number of people without a sister is tiny compared to those with a sister, the overall probability of lung cancer is still lower than the probability of absence of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
