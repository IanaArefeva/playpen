The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 68%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 53%. For infants with smoking mothers, would it be more likely to see high infant mortality if the infant had a nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since health condition is unobserved, we must consider its potential impact on the relationship between maternal smoking and infant mortality. If health condition has a strong positive effect on birth weight and a negative effect on infant mortality, then the higher birth weight associated with a health condition could offset the negative effect of a health condition on infant mortality, leading to a lower probability of high infant mortality in the presence of a health condition. In this case, the direct effect of the health condition on birth weight and infant mortality would counteract the direct negative effect of a health condition on infant mortality, leading to a lower probability of high infant mortality in the presence of a health condition. This means that for infants with a health condition, the probability of high infant mortality might be lower than for those without a health condition, which in turn means that the probability of high infant mortality for an infant with a smoking mother might be lower than for an infant with a nonsmoking mother, especially if the health condition has a strong positive effect on birth weight and a negative effect on infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
