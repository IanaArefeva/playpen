The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and freckles. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on freckles. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 86%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 51%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 77%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 42%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 76%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of freckles is 43%. The overall probability of smoking is 82%. Will smoking decrease the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of freckles among nonsmokers is higher than among smokers when there is no tar deposit (77% vs. 76%). This suggests that the absence of smoking may lead to a higher chance of freckles, especially in the absence of tar deposit. Additionally, the probability of freckles among both nonsmokers and smokers is lower when there is a high tar deposit (42% and 43%, respectively), which further blurs the direct link between smoking and freckles.||",
