The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 3%. The probability of high school degree or lower and high salary is 11%. The probability of college degree or higher and high salary is 2%. Is the chance of high salary larger when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that only a small fraction of the population with a college degree or higher also has a high salary. In fact, the probability of college degree or higher and high salary is less than the probability of college degree or higher (3% vs 2%). This suggests that having a college degree or higher does not increase the chance of having a high salary in this world.<|eot_id|>",
