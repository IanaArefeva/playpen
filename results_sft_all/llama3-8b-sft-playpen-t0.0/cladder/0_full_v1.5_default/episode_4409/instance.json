Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 56%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 83%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 42%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 83%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 48%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 74%. The overall probability of smoking is 45%.
