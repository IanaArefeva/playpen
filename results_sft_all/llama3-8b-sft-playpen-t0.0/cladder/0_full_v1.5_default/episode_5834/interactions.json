The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 80%. For people who have a sister, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between having a sister and tar deposit is that having a sister directly affects the probability of tar deposit, with a higher probability of tar deposit when having a sister. The direct relationship between tar deposit and lung cancer is that a higher probability of tar deposit directly affects the probability of lung cancer, with a higher probability of lung cancer when there is a higher probability of tar deposit. In this system, the direct relationships between the variables imply that the probability of lung cancer is higher when there is a higher probability of having a sister, and that the probability of having a sister is higher than the probability of not having a sister. The counterfactual question of whether it is more likely to see lung cancer if the person did not have a sister is not directly answerable from the given relationships, as the direct relationships imply that having a sister is associated with a higher probability of lung cancer, and that the person with a sister already has a higher probability of lung cancer than the person without a sister.||",
