The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 53%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 29%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between effort and college admission is that higher effort leads to higher college admission probability, but this does not imply that the difference in college admission probability between smokers and nonsmokers is due to differences in effort. The correct answer is \"No\" since the direct relationship between smoking and college admission is not through the intermediate variable of effort, and the difference in college admission probability between smokers and nonsmokers is not due to differences in effort.||",
