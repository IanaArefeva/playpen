The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 26%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 49%. Will taking medication increase the chance of healthy heart?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, the direct effect of medication on heart condition is not the only relevant relationship here. The direct effect of blood pressure on heart condition is also positive, meaning that higher blood pressure is associated with a lower probability of a healthy heart. Since medication has a direct effect on blood pressure, we need to consider the joint effect of medication on both heart condition and blood pressure. If medication were to reduce blood pressure, it could counteract its positive direct effect on heart condition, leading to a net negative effect on heart condition. In this case, the positive direct effect of medication on heart condition is offset by its negative direct effect on blood pressure, which in turn affects heart condition.||",
