Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 18%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 70%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 82%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 74%. The overall probability of smoking is 42%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?",
