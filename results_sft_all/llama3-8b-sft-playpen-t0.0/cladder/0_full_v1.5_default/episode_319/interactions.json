The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on skin. Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 24%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 68%. Will tanning salon treatment increase the chance of tanned skin?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of tanned skin is also directly affected by the action of \"going to the beach\". The probability of tanned skin for people not using tanning salon treatments is 24%, which is higher than the 0% probability for people who have not used tanning salon treatments and have not gone to the beach. This suggests that \"going to the beach\" has a positive effect on skin, which is separate from the direct effect of \"tanning salon treatment\" on skin. Since the probability of tanned skin for people who have used tanning salon treatments is 68%, which is higher than the 24% probability for people who have not used tanning salon treatments, we can conclude that tanning salon treatment does not increase the chance of tanned skin, as the increase in probability is likely due to the separate effect of \"going to the beach\" rather than the direct effect of \"tanning salon treatment\" on skin.||",
