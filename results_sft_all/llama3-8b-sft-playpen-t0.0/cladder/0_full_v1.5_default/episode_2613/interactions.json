The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 96%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 2%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 65%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
