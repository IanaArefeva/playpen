Skill has a direct effect on salary. We know that college degree or higher causes low skill level, and we know that high skill level causes low salary. Would the employee has a high salary if high school degree or lower instead of college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, college degree or higher is a necessary condition for both lower skill and lower salary. If we consider the counterfactual where the person has a high school degree or lower, we must conclude that this person would have a higher skill level than someone with a college degree or higher. Since high skill level is associated with lower salary, we can conclude that this person would have a lower salary than someone with a college degree or higher.<|eot_id|>",
