The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 16%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 93%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 23%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 50%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 12%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 38%. The overall probability of smoking is 50%. Does smoking negatively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is positive, as seen in the table where the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers in every condition. The direct relationship between tar deposit and lung cancer is also positive, as the probability of lung cancer is higher for those with high tar deposit than for those with no tar deposit in every condition. The negative relationship between smoking and lung cancer through the intervening variable of tar deposit is not supported by the data, as the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers in every condition, and the probability of lung cancer is higher for those with high tar deposit than for those with no tar deposit in every condition.||",
