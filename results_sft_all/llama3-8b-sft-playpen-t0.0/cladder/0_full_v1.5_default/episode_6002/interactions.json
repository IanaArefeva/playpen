The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that solar eclipse or heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is no traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if no solar eclipse instead of solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we are given that there is no traffic on the road, we can conclude that the direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival at school is the only active cause in this scenario. If there were no solar eclipse, the direct cause of Alice's arrival at school would be absent, and we have no information about any other potential causes (such as light rain or a perfectly smooth road) that might still lead to Alice's on-time arrival.||",
