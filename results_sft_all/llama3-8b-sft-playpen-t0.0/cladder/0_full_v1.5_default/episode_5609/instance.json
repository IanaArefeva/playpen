For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 74%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 24%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 2%. The overall probability of old age is 40%. Will high hospital bill decrease the chance of thick lips?",
