The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 83%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 52%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 45%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 21%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 99%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 28%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would encouragement level positively affect brown eyes?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the condition where students are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of brown eyes is 52%, which is higher than the 45% probability when students are not encouraged and do not study hard. This suggests that studying habits play a more significant role than encouragement in determining the probability of brown eyes.<|eot_id|>",
