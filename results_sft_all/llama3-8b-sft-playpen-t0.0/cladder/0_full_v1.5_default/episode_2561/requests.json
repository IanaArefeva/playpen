The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 87%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and high infant mortality is 8%. The probability of smoking mother and high infant mortality is 37%. Is the chance of high infant mortality smaller when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between health condition and both birth weight and mortality is also clear. The direct relationship between birth weight and mortality is also clear. The key point here is that the health condition is unobserved, and its direct relationship with both birth weight and mortality is not accounted for in the given probabilities. The probability of high infant mortality given a smoking mother is 37%, which is higher than the probability of high infant mortality given a nonsmoking mother (8%). This suggests that the health condition could be a confounding variable that affects both birth weight and mortality, and that its effect is not fully captured by the direct relationship between maternal smoking and infant's birth weight and mortality.<|eot_id|>",
