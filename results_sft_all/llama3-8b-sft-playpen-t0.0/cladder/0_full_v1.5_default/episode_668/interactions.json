The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of encouragement is 47%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 25%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 75%. Is high exam score less likely than low exam score overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The given probabilities of exam score for students who are and are not encouraged already account for the joint effects of encouragement and studying habits on exam score. Since the probability of exam score is already conditionally dependent on encouragement and studying habits, we can conclude that exam score is conditionally independent of encouragement given studying habits, and conditionally independent of studying habits given encouragement. This means that the joint probability of exam score and encouragement (or exam score and studying habits) is the product of the individual probabilities, and the overall probability of exam score is the same as the probability of exam score for students who are not encouraged, which is 25%.||",
