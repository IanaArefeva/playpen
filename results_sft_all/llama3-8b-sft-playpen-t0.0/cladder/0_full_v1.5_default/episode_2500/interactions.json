The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 92%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 81%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 17%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 5%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 49%. Will receives treatment decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

          "content": "No\nThe key insight here is that the direct effect of kidney stone size on recovery is more significant than the direct effect of treatment on recovery. In other words, the size of the kidney stone is a more important determinant of the patient's chance of recovery than whether or not they are receiving treatment. The large difference in recovery probability between small and large kidney stone patients (92% vs 17%) compared to the smaller difference in recovery probability between treated and untreated patients (81% vs 92% for small kidney stone patients and 5% vs 17% for large kidney stone patients) suggests that the size of the kidney stone is the primary driver of the patient's chance of recovery. Since Will has a large kidney stone, which already places them in a high-risk category for poor recovery, the additional effect of not receiving treatment is likely to be minimal compared to the already significant negative impact of having a large kidney stone.||",
