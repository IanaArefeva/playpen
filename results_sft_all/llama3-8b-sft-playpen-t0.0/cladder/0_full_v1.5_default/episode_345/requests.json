Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 4%. The probability of no tanning salon treatment and tanned skin is 7%. The probability of tanning salon treatment and tanned skin is 3%. Is the chance of tanned skin larger when observing tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that the chance of tanned skin is not larger when observing tanning salon treatment.<|eot_id|>",
