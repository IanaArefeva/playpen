The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 39%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 48%. Will smoking gene increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The gene also has an indirect effect on lung cancer through its relationship with smoking. Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for people with smoking genes (48%) than for those without (39%), we can conclude that the gene does not directly increase the chance of lung cancer, but rather does so by increasing the likelihood of smoking, which in turn leads to a higher risk of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
