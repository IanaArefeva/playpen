The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. For hospitalized individuals, the correlation between drinking coffee and broken bones is -0.16. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does it mean that drinking coffee does not affect broken bones?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The negative correlation could be a result of hospitalization being a common cause for both coffee consumption and broken bones, rather than a direct causal relationship between the two. In other words, hospitalization could lead to both a higher likelihood of coffee consumption and a higher likelihood of broken bones, but this does not imply that coffee consumption directly affects the risk of broken bones.||",
