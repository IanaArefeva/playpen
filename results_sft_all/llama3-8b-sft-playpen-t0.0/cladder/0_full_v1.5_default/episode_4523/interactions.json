The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and brown eyes. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on brown eyes. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 49%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and brown eyes is 37%. The probability of smoking mother and brown eyes is 23%. Is the chance of brown eyes smaller when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between the mother's smoking status and brown eyes is positive, meaning that the probability of brown eyes is higher when the mother smokes. The unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both the mother's smoking status and brown eyes, which further complicates the relationship between the two. The correct approach is to consider the joint probability of the two conditions (smoking mother and brown eyes) and the separate probabilities of each condition. The joint probability of a smoking mother and brown eyes is 23%, which is lower than the separate probability of a brown eye (37%) and higher than the separate probability of a smoking mother (49%). This pattern of joint probability being lower than the separate probabilities of the two conditions suggests that the chance of brown eyes is not smaller when observing a smoking mother.||",
