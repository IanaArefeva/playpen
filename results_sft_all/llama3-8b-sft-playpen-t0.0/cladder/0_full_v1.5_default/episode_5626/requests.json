Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of speaking english is 33%. The probability of not speaking english and recovery is 21%. The probability of speaking english and recovery is 25%.

The joint probability of speaking English and recovery is 25%, which is higher than the probability of not speaking English and recovery (21%). This suggests that, in this specific context, the ability to speak English is associated with a higher chance of recovery, rather than a lower one.<|eot_id|>",
