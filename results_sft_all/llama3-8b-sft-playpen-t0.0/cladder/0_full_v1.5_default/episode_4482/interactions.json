The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 36%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 57%. Will listening to jazz decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key issue is whether the increase in lung cancer risk associated with jazz is offset by the reduction in risk associated with the lower probability of lung cancer among those who do not listen to jazz. In this case, the probability of lung cancer among those who do not listen to jazz is 36%, which is lower than the 57% probability among those who do listen to jazz. This suggests that not listening to jazz is associated with a lower risk of lung cancer, and therefore, in this specific context, not listening to jazz would likely decrease the chance of lung cancer.||",
