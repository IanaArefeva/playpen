The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 81%. For people without a college degree, the probability of large feet is 75%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of large feet is 40%. Is large feet less likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of large feet is higher for those without a college degree (75%) than for those with a college degree or higher (40%), and the probability of college degree or higher is 81%, we can conclude that large feet are more likely than small feet overall.<|eot_id|>",
