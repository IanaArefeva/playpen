The candle has a direct effect on room. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 84%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 50%. Will drinking coffee decrease the chance of dark room?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a dark room is still higher than 50% for both coffee drinkers and non-coffee drinkers, which means that the candle's direct effect on room is more significant than the coffee's direct effect.<|eot_id|>",
