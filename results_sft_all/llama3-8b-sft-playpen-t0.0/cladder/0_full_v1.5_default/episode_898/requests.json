The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 53%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 95%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 26%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 63%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 86%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 7%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking positively affect college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the case of smokers who are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 63%, which is lower than the 95% probability of college admission for nonsmokers who are hard-working. This suggests that, in the absence of any mediating effects through effort, smoking does not have a positive direct effect on college admission.<|eot_id|>",
