The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 61%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 33%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 76%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 38%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 26%. The overall probability of smoking is 10%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with no tar deposit is 76%, which is higher than the probability of lung cancer among smokers with no tar deposit (60%). This suggests that the absence of smoking does not guarantee a lower risk of lung cancer, especially when there is no tar deposit. Additionally, the probability of lung cancer among smokers with high tar deposit is 26%, which is lower than the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with high tar deposit (38%). This indicates that the presence of smoking can lead to a lower risk of lung cancer when there is a high tar deposit. Finally, the overall probability of smoking is only 10%, which means that the vast majority of the population is not smoking. In this context, the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer is not strong enough to conclude that smoking will decrease the chance of lung cancer.||",
