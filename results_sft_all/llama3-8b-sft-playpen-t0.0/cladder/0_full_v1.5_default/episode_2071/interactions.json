The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 68%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 46%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 33%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 2%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 35%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 6%. Does encouragement level positively affect exam score through studying habit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a high exam score is lower for students who are both encouraged and study hard (2%) than for students who are not encouraged and study hard (46%). This suggests that encouragement has a negative effect on exam score, or that there is an interaction between encouragement and studying habits that leads to a lower exam score when both are present.||",
