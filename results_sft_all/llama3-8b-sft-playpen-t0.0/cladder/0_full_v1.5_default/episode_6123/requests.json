The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that liking spicy food or confounder active causes high parental social status. liking spicy food and confounder active and high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder inactive. Would the child is not intelligent if liking spicy food instead of not liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we have a condition where liking spicy food and high parental social status lead to an intelligent child, we can conclude that the child will still be intelligent if we consider the case where the child's parents like spicy food. The active confounder does not play a role in this specific scenario, so we can focus on the direct relationships between the variables.<|eot_id|>",
