The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 61%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 81%. Does having a brother positively affect salary through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high skill among those with a brother is not directly quantified, and the relationship between having a brother and skill is not fully characterized. The given information only describes the relationship between having a brother and the probability of high salary, which is 81% for those with a brother and 61% for those without a brother. This does not directly imply that having a brother affects salary through skill, as the intervening variable of skill is not fully accounted for.<|eot_id|>",
