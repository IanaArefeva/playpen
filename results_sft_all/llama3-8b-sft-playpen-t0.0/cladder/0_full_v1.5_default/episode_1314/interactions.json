The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how smoking correlates with lung cancer in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to gender. To understand how smoking affects lung cancer, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this world, the direct relationship between smoke and lung cancer is different for each gender, and looking at the general relationship (Method 1) would lead to an incomplete or inaccurate picture of the relationship between smoke and lung cancer. Method 2, which looks at the relationship case by case according to gender, is more appropriate for understanding the specific relationship between smoke and lung cancer in each subpopulation.||",
