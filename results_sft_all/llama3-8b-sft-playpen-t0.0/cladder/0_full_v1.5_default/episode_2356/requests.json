The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 3%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 60%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 74%. Is scurvy more likely than no scurvy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of citrus consumption is only 3%, the overall probability of scurvy is primarily determined by the probability of scurvy in citrus non-consumers, which is 60%. This is higher than the probability of scurvy in citrus consumers, which is 74% of the 3% citrus consumption rate, equaling 0.222%. The higher base rate of scurvy in citrus non-consumers (60%) far outweighs the lower but higher risk of scurvy in citrus consumers (0.222%).<|eot_id|>",
