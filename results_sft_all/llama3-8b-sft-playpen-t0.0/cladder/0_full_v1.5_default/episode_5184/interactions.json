The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. The overall probability of encouragement is 98%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of brown eyes is 65%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of brown eyes is 62%. Is brown eyes less likely than blue eyes overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional information that the probability of brown eyes is 62% for students who are encouraged and 65% for students who are not encouraged further supports this conclusion. The higher probability of brown eyes in the absence of encouragement compared to the presence of encouragement also suggests that brown eyes are not less likely than blue eyes.||",
