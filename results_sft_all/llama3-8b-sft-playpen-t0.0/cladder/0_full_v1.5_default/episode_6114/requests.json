Since having a white-collar job is a necessary condition for having a high salary, and we already know that the person has a white-collar job, we can conclude that the person's white-collar job is the primary driver of their high salary. The direct effect of having visited England on white-collar job and salary is not strong enough to counteract the negative effect of the person's low skill level. In this scenario, the person's white-collar job is the primary cause of their high salary, and having visited England is not a sufficient condition to ensure a high salary given the person's low skill level.<|eot_id|>",
