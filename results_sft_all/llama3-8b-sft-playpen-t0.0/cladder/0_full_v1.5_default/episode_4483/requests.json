The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 2%. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 36%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 57%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since 98% of the population does not listen to jazz and the probability of lung cancer among this group is 36%, and only 2% of the population listens to jazz with a corresponding probability of 57% for lung cancer, the overall probability of lung cancer is (0.98 * 0.36) + (0.02 * 0.57) = 0.3514, which is less than 0.5, the probability of absence of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
