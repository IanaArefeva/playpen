The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 87%. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 88%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 67%. Is college admission less likely than college rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of college admission is 88% for nonsmokers and 67% for smokers, and since 87% of the population smokes, we can weight these probabilities by the fraction of the population that smokes and the fraction that doesn't smoke. The overall probability of college admission is then (0.87 * 0.67) + (0.13 * 0.88) = 0.73 + 0.11 = 0.84, which is higher than the probability of college rejection (1 - 0.84 = 0.16).||",
