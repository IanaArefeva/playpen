The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of male gender is 11%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 88%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 13%. Is being lactose intolerant more likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The overall probability of being male is 11%, which is lower than the 88% probability of being lactose intolerant for non-male. This suggests that the higher probability of being male does not offset the higher probability of being lactose intolerant for non-male, and the overall probability of being lactose intolerant is still higher than the probability of not being lactose intolerant.||",
