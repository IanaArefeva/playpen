Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of male gender is 11%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 88%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 13%. Is being lactose intolerant more likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of being male is 11%, which is lower than the 88% probability of being lactose intolerant for non-male. This suggests that the higher probability of being male does not offset the higher probability of being lactose intolerant for non-male, and the overall probability of being lactose intolerant is still higher than the probability of not being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
