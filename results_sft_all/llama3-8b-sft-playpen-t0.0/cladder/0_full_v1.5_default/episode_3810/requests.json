The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of being able to swim is 6%. The probability of not being able to swim and high exam score is 32%. The probability of being able to swim and high exam score is 4%. Is the chance of high exam score smaller when observing being able to swim?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between studying habits and exam score is also positive, meaning that higher studying habits should lead to a higher exam score. Since being able to swim is associated with higher exam scores, and higher exam scores are associated with higher studying habits, we can conclude that the chance of a high exam score is not smaller when observing being able to swim.<|eot_id|>",
