The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 94%. For people considered unattractive and are not famous, the probability of talent is 90%. For people considered unattractive and are famous, the probability of talent is 78%. For people considered attractive and are not famous, the probability of talent is 88%. For people considered attractive and are famous, the probability of talent is 68%. If we look at people who are famous, does the chance of talent increase when attractive appearance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of both appearance and talent on fame is established, and we have specific probabilities associated with different groups of people (unattractive and famous, unattractive and not famous, attractive and famous, and attractive and not famous). The goal is to see whether the chance of talent among famous people is higher when they are also attractive.\nTo answer this, we need to look at the probability of talent among famous people and see whether it is higher when they are also attractive. The probability of talent among famous people is 68% when they are also attractive and 78% when they are not. Since 68% is less than 78%, the chance of talent among famous people does not increase when they are also attractive.\nThis result might initially appear counterintuitive, as one might expect that being both famous and attractive would imply higher talent. However, the direct relationships between the variables and the specific probabilities given lead to this conclusion.||",
