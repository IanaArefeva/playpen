Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 6%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 42%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 76%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 87%. The overall probability of smoking is 58%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?",
