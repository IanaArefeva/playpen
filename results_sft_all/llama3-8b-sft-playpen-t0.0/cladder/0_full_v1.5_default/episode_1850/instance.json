Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of vaccination is 12%. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 42%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 33%.
