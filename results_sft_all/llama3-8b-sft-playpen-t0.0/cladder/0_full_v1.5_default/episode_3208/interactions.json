The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of dark room is 41%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of dark room is 74%. Will liking spicy food decrease the chance of dark room?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of dark room for people who like spicy food is 74%, which is higher than the probability of dark room for people who do not like spicy food (41%).
