The candle has a direct effect on room. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of dark room is 41%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of dark room is 74%. Will liking spicy food decrease the chance of dark room?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of dark room for people who like spicy food is 74%, which is higher than the probability of dark room for people who do not like spicy food (41%). This suggests that the direct effect of the candle on room is more significant than the direct effect of liking spicy food on room.<|eot_id|>",
