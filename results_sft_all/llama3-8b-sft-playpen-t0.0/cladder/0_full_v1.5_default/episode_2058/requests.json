The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 59%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 47%. For students who are encouraged, would it be less likely to see high exam score if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between studying habits and exam score is that higher studying habits lead to higher exam scores. Since encouragement is associated with lower exam scores, and higher exam scores are associated with higher studying habits, it's not clear whether encouragement would lead to lower exam scores through lower studying habits. In this world, the direct relationship between encouragement and exam score is the primary factor, and the relationship between studying habits and exam score is separate.<|eot_id|>",
