Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. We know that tanning salon treatment or going to the beach causes large feet. We observed the person does not go to the beach.

Since we know that tanning salon treatment or going to the beach causes large feet, and we also know that the person does not go to the beach, we can conclude that the person's large foot size is due to the tanning salon treatment. If we were to remove the tanning salon treatment, we would still be left with the beach as a potential cause of large foot size, since the person does not go to the beach, we can conclude that the person's large foot size is still present, and the absence of tanning salon treatment would not change the person's foot size.<|eot_id|>",
