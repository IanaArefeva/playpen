The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 5%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 44%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 4%. Is the chance of high rainfall larger when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between Alice's wakefulness and rainfall does not imply that the probability of high rainfall is higher when she wakes up late. The correct relationship is that the probability of high rainfall is the same in both scenarios (waking up late and on time), and it is also the same as the probability of high rainfall in the absence of any specific condition (since there are no unmentioned factors or causal relationships in this world).||",
