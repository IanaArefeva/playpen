The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. Method 1: We look at how education level correlates with salary case by case according to skill. Method 2: We look directly at how education level correlates with salary in general. To understand how education level affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this case, looking at the general relationship between education and salary (Method 2) would not account for the intervening effect of skill, which could lead to spurious correlations or confounding bias. In contrast, looking at the relationship between education and salary case by case according to skill (Method 1) would allow us to control for the intervening effect of skill and directly observe the relationship between education and salary, providing a more accurate measure of the direct effect of education on salary.||",
