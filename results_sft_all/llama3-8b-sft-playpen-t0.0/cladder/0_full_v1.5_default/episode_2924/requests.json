Since we already know that the person has a college degree or higher, we can conclude that their living close to a college is the cause of this higher education level. If we were to change the person's education level to high school degree or lower, we would be removing the direct effect of living close to a college on their education level. In that case, the only remaining cause of their college degree or higher is the active unobserved confounder. Since we also know that the person has a college degree or higher, we can conclude that the active unobserved confounder is the cause of this higher education level. If we then remove the active unobserved confounder, we would be removing the direct effect of the confounder on the person's education level. In that case, the person's living close to a college would no longer be the cause of their college degree or higher, and their education level would be determined by the direct effect of living close to a college, which is a high school degree or lower. Finally, since the person's living close to a college is the only remaining cause of their college degree or higher, we can conclude that their living close to a college is the cause of their college degree or higher, and their college degree or higher is the cause of their high salary.
