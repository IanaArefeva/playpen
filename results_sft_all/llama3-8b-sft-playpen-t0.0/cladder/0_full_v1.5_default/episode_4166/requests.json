The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of having a brother is 42%. For patients who do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 72%. For patients who have a brother, the probability of recovery is 34%. Is recovery less likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of being male on having a brother is also positive, as the probability of having a brother is higher for males (42%) than for females (0%). The direct effect of being male on recovery is negative, as the probability of recovery is lower for males (34%) than for females (72%). Since the direct effects of having a brother and being male on recovery are positive and negative, respectively, the overall probability of recovery is not less likely than non-recovery.<|eot_id|>",
