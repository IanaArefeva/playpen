The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of playing card games is 96%. The probability of not playing card games and long lifespan is 3%. The probability of playing card games and long lifespan is 54%. Is the chance of long lifespan smaller when observing playing card games?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In fact, the probability of long lifespan is higher when card games are played (54%) than when they are not (3%).
