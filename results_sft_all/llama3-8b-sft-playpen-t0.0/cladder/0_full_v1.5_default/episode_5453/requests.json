Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of playing card games is 96%. The probability of not playing card games and long lifespan is 3%. The probability of playing card games and long lifespan is 54%. Is the chance of long lifespan smaller when observing playing card games?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In fact, the probability of long lifespan is higher when card games are played (54%) than when they are not (3%). This suggests that card games are associated with a higher chance of long lifespan, rather than a lower one.<|eot_id|>",
