The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 71%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 25%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 88%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 45%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 91%. Will manager signing the termination letter decrease the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the manager's action of signing the termination letter does not reduce the chance of the employee being fired, and might even increase it in this specific context.||",
