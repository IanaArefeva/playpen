Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 82%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 20%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 68%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of ring alarm is a weighted average of these two probabilities, with the weights being the probability of each behavior. The probability of ring alarm is (0.4 * 0.82) + (0.2 * 0.18) = 0.3284 for those who drink coffee and 0.036 for those who do not. The overall probability of ring alarm is (0.4 * 0.3284) + (0.2 * 0.036) = 0.13136, which is less than the probability of a silent alarm (1 - 0.13136 = 0.86864).<|eot_id|>",
