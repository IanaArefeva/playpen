Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between listening to jazz and being hard-working is -0.15.

The relationship between these two variables is likely spurious, as both are associated with the same underlying cause (elite institution admission), rather than being causally connected. The direct effects of jazz and being hard-working on elite institution admission are separate from their joint relationship, which is being misinterpreted here.<|eot_id|>",
