The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 17%. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 51%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 49%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 84%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 30%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 38%. For managers who sign termination letters, would it be less likely to see employee being fired if the manager had signed the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this case, the probability of the director signing the termination letter is also 38%. The probability of the employee being fired when both the manager and the director sign the termination letter is 84%. In the absence of the manager's signature, the probability of the director signing the termination letter is 30%. The probability of the employee being fired when the manager doesn't sign the termination letter and the director does sign it is 51%. The difference in the probability of the employee being fired between the two scenarios is 33% (84% - 51%). This difference is larger than the difference in the probability of the manager and the director both signing the termination letter (38% - 30% = 8%). Therefore, it is less likely to see the employee being fired if the manager had signed the termination letter.<|eot_id|>",
