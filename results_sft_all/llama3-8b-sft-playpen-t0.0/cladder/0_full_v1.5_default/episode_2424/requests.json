Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 56%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 18%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 64%.

The probability of treatment is 56%, which is higher than the probability of non-recovery (44%). Since the probability of treatment is higher than the probability of non-recovery, and treatment directly leads to a higher probability of recovery, it can be inferred that the overall probability of recovery is higher than the probability of non-recovery.<|eot_id|>",
