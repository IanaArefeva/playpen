Effort has a direct effect on freckles. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of freckles is 49%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of freckles is 27%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of freckles is 87%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of freckles is 56%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 4%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 51%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect freckles?",
