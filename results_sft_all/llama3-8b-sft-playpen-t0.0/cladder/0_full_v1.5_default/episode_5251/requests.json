Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of freckles is 40%. For individuals who are male, the probability of freckles is 32%. Will male gender increase the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This reduction in probability directly counteracts the positive relationship between male gender and freckles, which is not present in this world.<|eot_id|>",
