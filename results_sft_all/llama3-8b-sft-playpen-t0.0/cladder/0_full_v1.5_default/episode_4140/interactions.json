The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and rainfall. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of high rainfall is 43%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of high rainfall is 36%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 52%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 82%. Will increased supply increase the chance of high rainfall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since demand is unobserved, we can't conclude that demand is the direct cause of the change in supply. The direct relationship between demand and supply, and the unobserved demand, make it uncertain whether an increase in demand will lead to an increase in supply.||",
