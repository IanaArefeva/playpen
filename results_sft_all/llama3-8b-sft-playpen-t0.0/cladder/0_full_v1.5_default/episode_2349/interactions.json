The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. The overall probability of citrus intake is 12%. The probability of absence of citrus and scurvy is 34%. The probability of citrus intake and scurvy is 2%. Is the chance of scurvy larger when observing citrus intake?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of citrus intake is 12%, and the probability of citrus and scurvy is 2%. This means that the direct relationship between citrus and scurvy is not strong, and the intervening role of vitmain C likely dilutes the effect of citrus on scurvy. In particular, the 2% probability of citrus and scurvy is lower than the 12% probability of citrus, which suggests that citrus does not directly cause scurvy.||",
