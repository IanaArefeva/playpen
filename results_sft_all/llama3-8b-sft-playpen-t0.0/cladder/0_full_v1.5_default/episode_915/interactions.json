The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 63%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 42%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between effort and college admission is that higher effort leads to higher college admission probability. Since the student is a smoker, we already know that their college admission probability is lower than that of a nonsmoker. The additional information that the student exerts more effort than a typical smoker does not change the direct relationship between smoking and college admission, which remains that smoking leads to lower college admission probability.||",
