The direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition is that having a sister leads to a lower blood pressure, which in turn leads to a heart condition. If the person does not have a sister, they will have higher blood pressure, which directly affects their heart condition. Since having a sister and high blood pressure lead to a healthy heart, the absence of a sister and higher blood pressure will lead to an unhealthy heart.<|eot_id|>",
