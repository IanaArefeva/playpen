The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. We know that male gender causes non-competitive department. male gender or competitive department causes admission acceptance. Would the applicant gets admitted if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between male gender and admission acceptance further solidifies this outcome. If the applicant is male, they will be in a non-competitive department and will likely be accepted into the program. If the applicant is not male (female), they will be in a competitive department, which still leads to admission acceptance. The chain of cause and effect remains the same, and the applicant's admission is still dependent on their male gender rather than their departmental competition.||",
