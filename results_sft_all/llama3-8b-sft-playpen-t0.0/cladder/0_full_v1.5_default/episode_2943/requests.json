The direct relationship between male gender and admission acceptance further solidifies this outcome. If the applicant is male, they will be in a non-competitive department and will likely be accepted into the program. If the applicant is not male (female), they will be in a competitive department, which still leads to admission acceptance. The chain of cause and effect remains the same, and the applicant's admission is still dependent on their male gender rather than their departmental competition.<|eot_id|>",
