The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 51%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 18%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 34%. Is the chance of intelligent child larger when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since parents' social status is also directly affected by parents' intelligence, this creates a negative feedback loop that dilutes the positive effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence. In particular, the direct effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence is likely to be more pronounced than the direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence, given that social status is typically a more visible and influential factor in children's lives. This negative feedback loop means that the chance of an intelligent child is not larger when observing intelligent parents, and in fact, the opposite may be true.<|eot_id|>",
