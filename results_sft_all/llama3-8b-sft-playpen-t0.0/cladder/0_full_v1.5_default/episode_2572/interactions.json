The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 94%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and high infant mortality is 5%. The probability of smoking mother and high infant mortality is 43%. Is the chance of high infant mortality smaller when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between health condition and both birth weight and infant mortality is also clear. The direct relationship between birth weight and infant mortality is also clear. The key point here is that the health condition is unobserved, and its direct relationship with both birth weight and infant mortality is not accounted for in the direct relationships between maternal smoking and birth weight, and between birth weight and infant mortality. The health condition could be the primary cause of both high birth weight and high infant mortality, and its unobserved nature means that we can't conclude that the chance of high infant mortality is smaller when observing a smoking mother.||",
