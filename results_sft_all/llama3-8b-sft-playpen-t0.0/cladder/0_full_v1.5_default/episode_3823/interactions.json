The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Method 1: We look at how gender correlates with peanut allergy case by case according to department competitiveness. Method 2: We look directly at how gender correlates with peanut allergy in general. To understand how gender affects peanut allergy, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional condition that \"Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy\" means that the relationship between gender and peanut allergy is not direct but rather mediated by the intervening variable of \"department competitiveness\". In this case, looking at the general relationship between gender and peanut allergy (Method 2) would not account for the intervening effect of \"department competitiveness\" and might lead to a spurious conclusion. In contrast, looking at the relationship between gender and peanut allergy on a case-by-case basis according to \"department competitiveness\" (Method 1) would allow us to control for this intervening variable and more accurately identify the direct relationship between gender and peanut allergy.||",
