Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of speaking english is 50%. The probability of not speaking english and recovery is 16%. The probability of speaking english and recovery is 40%.

The joint probability of not speaking English and recovery is 16%, and the joint probability of speaking English and recovery is 40%. The difference in joint probabilities does not directly translate to a difference in the chance of recovery when observing speaking English, as the joint probability of not speaking English and recovery is already accounted for in the overall probability of not speaking English (50%).<|eot_id|>",
