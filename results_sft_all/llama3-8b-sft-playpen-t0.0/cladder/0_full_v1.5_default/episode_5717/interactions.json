The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 46%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 71%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 18%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 46%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 59%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 19%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 83%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 44%. The overall probability of good health is 18%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would having a sister positively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The health condition of the child also affects the birth weight, and having a sister can lead to a higher probability of having a child with a health condition that is associated with lower birth weight. In the absence of direct measurement of health condition, we must consider the joint effect of having a sister and health condition on birth weight. The joint probability of having a child with a health condition and a child with a normal birth weight is higher for children who have a sister than for those who do not have a sister. This joint probability is 0.26 for children who have a sister and 0.16 for children who do not have a sister. The joint probability of having a child with a health condition and a child with a normal birth weight is higher for children who have a sister than for those who do not have a sister. This joint probability is 0.26 for children who have a sister and 0.16 for children who do not have a sister.
