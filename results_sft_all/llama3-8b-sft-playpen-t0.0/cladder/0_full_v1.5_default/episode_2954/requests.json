The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the resident is in-state. Would the applicant gets admitted if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that the applicant is in-state, the direct effect of in-state residency on competitive department supersedes the direct effect of male gender on competitive department. This means that the male gender does not uniquely cause a competitive department in this specific context. The in-state residency is the primary cause of a competitive department, and the male gender does not add any additional causal force in this particular situation.<|eot_id|>",
