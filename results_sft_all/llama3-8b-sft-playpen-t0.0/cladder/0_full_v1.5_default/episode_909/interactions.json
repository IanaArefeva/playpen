The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 51%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 89%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 11%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 34%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 91%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 63%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In fact, the probability of college admission for smokers who are hard-working is 34%, which is higher than the probability of college admission for nonsmokers who are lazy (51%).
