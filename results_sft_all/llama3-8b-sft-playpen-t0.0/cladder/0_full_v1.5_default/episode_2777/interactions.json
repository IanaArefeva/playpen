The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how water quality correlates with cholera case by case according to poverty. Method 2: We look directly at how water quality correlates with cholera in general. To understand how water quality affects cholera, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we are looking at the direct relationship between water quality and cholera, we can directly measure this relationship without needing to condition on the unobserved variable of poverty. Method 2 is more appropriate in this case, as it directly assesses the relationship between water quality and cholera without relying on the unobserved variable of poverty.||",
