The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of speaking english is 81%. For people who do not speak english and are not famous, the probability of talent is 94%. For people who do not speak english and are famous, the probability of talent is 83%. For people who speak english and are not famous, the probability of talent is 92%. For people who speak english and are famous, the probability of talent is 75%. If we look at people who are famous, does the chance of talent increase when speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
