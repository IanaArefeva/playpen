Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 38%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 44%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 28%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 51%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?",
