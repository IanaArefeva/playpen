The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 38%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 44%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 28%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 51%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is counterintuitive and likely due to the unobserved confounder that affects both maternal smoking and birth weight. The unobserved confounder likely has a positive effect on birth weight and a negative effect on smoking behavior, which is why we see a positive relationship between smoking and birth weight in this setting.<|eot_id|>",
