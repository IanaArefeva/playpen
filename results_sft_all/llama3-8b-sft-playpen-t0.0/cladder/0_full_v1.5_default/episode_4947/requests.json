The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Vaccination status has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on black hair. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of vaccination is 2%. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of black hair is 43%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of black hair is 54%. Is black hair more likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of black hair is also directly related to the probability of smallpox, which is in turn related to the probability of not being vaccinated (since the probability of smallpox is higher for unvaccinated than for vaccinated). The probability of black hair is 43% for unvaccinated and 54% for vaccinated, which means that the overall probability of black hair is likely to be higher than the probability of black hair among the unvaccinated alone, since the unvaccinated make up only a small fraction of the total population (2% are vaccinated, so 98% are unvaccinated).<|eot_id|>",
