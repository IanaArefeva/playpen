The direct relationship between having a sister and heart condition is that having a sister is associated with a lower risk of heart condition, not a higher risk. The person's heart condition is directly related to their blood pressure, which is also directly related to having a sister. If the person has a sister, they are likely to have lower blood pressure, which in turn would lead to a lower risk of heart condition. In this case, the person would not have a healthy heart.<|eot_id|>",
