Since the person is close to a college, they drink coffee, which also directly affects their salary. The active confounder and the person's coffee consumption both lead to a high salary. If the person were not to drink coffee, the active confounder would still lead to a high salary, so the person's salary would not be lower than it is now.<|eot_id|>",
