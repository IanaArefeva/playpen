Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active or close to a college causes drinking coffee. confounder active and drinking coffee causes high salary. We observed the person lives close to a college and confounder inactive.
