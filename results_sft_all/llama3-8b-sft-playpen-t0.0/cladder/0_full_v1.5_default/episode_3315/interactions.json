The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of having a sister is 41%. The probability of not having a sister and the prisoner's death is 17%. The probability of having a sister and the prisoner's death is 20%. Is the chance of the prisoner's death larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between the corporal and the prisoner is also not immediately clear. The direct relationship between the private and the prisoner is also not immediately clear. The only direct relationship that is clear is between having a sister and the private's state. The probability of having a sister is 41%, and the probability of having a sister and the prisoner's death is 20%. The probability of not having a sister and the prisoner's death is 17%. The probability of having a sister and the private's state is not directly provided, but we can conclude that the chance of the prisoner's death is larger when not observing having a sister, since the probability of not having a sister and the prisoner's death (17%) is higher than the probability of having a sister and the prisoner's death (20%).||",
