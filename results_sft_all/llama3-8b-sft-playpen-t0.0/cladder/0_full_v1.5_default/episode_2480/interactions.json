The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 95%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 83%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 20%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 9%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 41%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\n\nLet's first consider the counterfactual of a patient with a large kidney stone not receiving treatment. In this case, the probability of recovery is 20%. Now, if we consider the counterfactual of a patient with a large kidney stone who does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 9%. This means that, in both scenarios, the probability of recovery is lower than the probability of recovery for a patient with a small kidney stone (95% and 83%, respectively). This suggests that the direct effect of kidney stone size on recovery is more significant than the direct effect of treatment on recovery.\n\nNext, we need to consider the counterfactual of a patient with a small kidney stone who does not receive treatment. In this case, the probability of recovery is 95%. This is higher than the probability of recovery for a patient with a large kidney stone who does not receive treatment (20%). This further supports the idea that the direct effect of kidney stone size on recovery is more significant than the direct effect of treatment on recovery.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that Will's kidney stone size is the primary driver of the probability of recovery, and the direct effect of kidney stone size on recovery is more significant than the direct",
