Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 47%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 50%. Will smoking mother decrease the chance of high infant mortality?",
