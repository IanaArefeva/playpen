The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 48%. For patients who pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 68%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 34%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since hospital costs have a direct effect on both hospital bill and recovery, we can conclude that hospital costs are a confounding variable in the relationship between age and recovery. The given probabilities of hospital bill and recovery do not directly imply a relationship between age and recovery, and we must consider the joint effect of hospital costs on both hospital bill and recovery. The probability of high hospital bill is 48%, and for those who pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 34%. This means that a large fraction of the population will have a high hospital bill and a lower probability of recovery. In light of this, we conclude that, overall, non-recovery is more likely than recovery.<|eot_id|>",
