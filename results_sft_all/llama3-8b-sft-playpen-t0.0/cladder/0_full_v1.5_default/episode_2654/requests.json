The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 75%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 6%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 44%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer is also directly related to the probability of not smoking, which is 25%. Since the probability of lung cancer when not smoking is 6%, and the probability of not smoking is 25%, the overall probability of lung cancer is higher than the probability of lung cancer when smoking, which is 44%.<|eot_id|>",
