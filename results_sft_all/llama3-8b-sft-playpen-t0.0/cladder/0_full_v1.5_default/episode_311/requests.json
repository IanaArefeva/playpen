The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 79%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 81%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 41%. Is arriving to school on time less likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of Alice waking up on time is 1 - 0.79 = 0.21. The probability of Alice waking up on time and then arriving on time is 0.21 * 0.81 = 0.1701. The probability of Alice waking up late is 0.79. The probability of Alice waking up late and still arriving on time is 0.79 * 0.41 = 0.3239. The total probability of Alice arriving to school on time is 0.1701 + 0.3239 = 0.494. The probability of Alice arriving to school late is 1 - 0.494 = 0.506. Since 0.494 is less than 0.506, the probability of Alice arriving to school on time is less than the probability of Alice arriving to school late.<|eot_id|>",
