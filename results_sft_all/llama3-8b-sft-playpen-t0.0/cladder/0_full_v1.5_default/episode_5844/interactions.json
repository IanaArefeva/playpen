The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of having a sister is 8%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 29%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 92% of the population does not have a sister, and among them, 29% have lung cancer. The remaining 8% have a sister, and among them, 64% have lung cancer. To find the overall probability of lung cancer, we need to consider both groups. The probability of lung cancer for the entire population is a weighted average of the two groups, where the weight is the proportion of each group in the population. The probability of lung cancer for the entire population is (0.92 * 0.29) + (0.08 * 0.64) = 0.2664 + 0.0512 = 0.3176. Since 0.3176 is less than 0.5, the probability of lung cancer is less than the probability of absence of lung cancer overall.||",
