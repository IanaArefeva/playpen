  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 48%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 72%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 16%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 37%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 52%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 26%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 78%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 57%. The overall probability of good health is 1%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would having a sister negatively affect infant mortality?",
