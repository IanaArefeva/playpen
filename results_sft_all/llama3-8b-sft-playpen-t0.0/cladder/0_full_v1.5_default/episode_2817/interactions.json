The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes manager not signing the termination letter and director signing the termination letter. manager signing the termination letter or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to retain the employee. Would the employee is not fired if manager not signing the termination letter instead of manager signing the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The manager's behavior is not an independent intervening variable that could change the outcome of the employee being fired. The chain of causality is as follows: CEO's decision to fire the employee leads to the manager not signing the letter, which in turn leads to the director signing the letter, and finally, the director's action leads to the employee being fired. If the manager were to not sign the letter instead of the director, it would still lead to the same outcome of the employee being fired, as the manager's behavior is already determined by the CEO's decision.||",
