The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and freckles. Effort has a direct effect on freckles. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of freckles is 38%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of freckles is 9%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of freckles is 65%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of freckles is 38%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 20%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 79%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking positively affect freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
