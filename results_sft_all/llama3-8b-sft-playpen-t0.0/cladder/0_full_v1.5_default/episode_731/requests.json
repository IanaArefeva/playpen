Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 67%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 61%. For individuals who are male, would it be less likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that being male directly decreases the likelihood of admission acceptance by 6%. The counterfactual question is whether it would be less likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male. In this case, the counterfactual is that the individual is not male, which means they are female. The probability of admission acceptance for females is 67%, which is higher than the probability for males (61%). This indicates that being male does not lead to a lower likelihood of admission acceptance compared to being female.<|eot_id|>",
