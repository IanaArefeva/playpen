The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 3%. The probability of not drinking coffee and dark room is 82%. The probability of drinking coffee and dark room is 1%. Is the chance of dark room smaller when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a dark room is primarily determined by the candle, and the probability of coffee consumption is only 3%. The 1% probability of both coffee and a dark room is still a small fraction of the total probability of a dark room, which is mostly determined by the candle.<|eot_id|>",
