The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that intelligent parents and confounder active causes high parental social status. intelligent parents or confounder active or high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder active. Would the child is intelligent if intelligent parents instead of unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This creates a potential confounding situation where the relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence could be influenced by unobserved factors that also affect parents' social status. Since we know that intelligent parents and the active confounder both lead to high parental social status, and that this high social status in turn affects child's intelligence, we must carefully consider the role of the active confounder in this chain of causality. If we were to substitute intelligent parents for unintelligent parents, we would still have the active confounder present, which would likely lead to high parental social status and, in turn, an intelligent child. This suggests that the child would still be intelligent under this scenario.||",
