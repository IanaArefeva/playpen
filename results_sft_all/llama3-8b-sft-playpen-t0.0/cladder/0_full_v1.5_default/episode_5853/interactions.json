The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 89%. Will having a sister decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The correct chain of causality is: having a sister affects the probability of tar deposit, and the probability of lung cancer is directly related to the probability of tar deposit. In this world, having a sister does not directly reduce the chance of lung cancer; it only affects the chance of having a higher probability of lung cancer through its effect on the probability of tar deposit.||",
