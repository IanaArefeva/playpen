The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of speaking english is 12%. The probability of not speaking english and long lifespan is 59%. The probability of speaking english and long lifespan is 4%. Is the chance of long lifespan smaller when observing speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only direct relationship we have is that between diabetes and long lifespan, which is negative. The relationship between speaking English and long lifespan is not direct; it is through the intermediate variable of diabetes. If we condition on not speaking English, we have a 59% chance of having a long lifespan, which is higher than the 4% chance of having a long lifespan when we condition on speaking English. This suggests that not speaking English is associated with a higher chance of having a long lifespan.||",
