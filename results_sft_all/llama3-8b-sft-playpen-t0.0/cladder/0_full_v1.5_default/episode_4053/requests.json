Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of speaking english is 12%. The probability of not speaking english and long lifespan is 59%. The probability of speaking english and long lifespan is 4%.

The only direct relationship we have is that between diabetes and long lifespan, which is negative. The relationship between speaking English and long lifespan is not direct; it is through the intermediate variable of diabetes. If we condition on not speaking English, we have a 59% chance of having a long lifespan, which is higher than the 4% chance of having a long lifespan when we condition on speaking English. This suggests that not speaking English is associated with a higher chance of having a long lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
