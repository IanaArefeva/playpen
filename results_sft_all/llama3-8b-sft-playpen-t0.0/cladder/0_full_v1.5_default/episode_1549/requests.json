The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 53%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 22%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 73%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 42%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 81%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In both scenarios, the probability of the employee being fired is lower than the corresponding probability when the manager does not sign the termination letter (53% and 73%, respectively). This suggests that the manager's action of signing the termination letter actually decreases the chance of the employee being fired, rather than increasing it.<|eot_id|>",
