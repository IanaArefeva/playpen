Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 89%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 77%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 45%. Is admission acceptance more likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Additionally, the direct relationship between male gender and lower department competitiveness further supports this conclusion. Since the probability of male gender is 89%, this bias towards lower admission likelihood likely skews the overall probability of admission acceptance below 50%.<|eot_id|>",
