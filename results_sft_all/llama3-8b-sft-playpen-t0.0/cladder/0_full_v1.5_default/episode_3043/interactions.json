The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives no treatment. large kidney stone or receives treatment causes recovery. We observed the patient has a large kidney stone. Would the patient doesn't recover if receives no treatment instead of receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since large kidney stone size is associated with no treatment, we can conclude that the patient will not be treated. The direct relationship between large kidney stone size and no treatment means that the patient's large kidney stone size is the cause of the no treatment condition. In this case, the patient's large kidney stone size is the direct cause of the no treatment condition, and the no treatment condition is the direct cause of the patient not recovering. This chain of causality means that the large kidney stone size is the root cause of the patient not recovering, rather than the no treatment condition being the direct cause of the patient not recovering.||",
