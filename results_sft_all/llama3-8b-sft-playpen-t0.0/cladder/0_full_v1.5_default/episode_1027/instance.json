Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 60%. The probability of reduced supply and increased price is 25%. The probability of increased supply and increased price is 24%. Is the chance of increased price smaller when observing increased supply?",
