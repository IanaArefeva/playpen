The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of being able to swim is 15%. For students who cannot swim, the probability of high exam score is 16%. For students who can swim, the probability of high exam score is 85%. Is high exam score less likely than low exam score overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The studying habits of students who can and cannot swim are not directly related to their exam scores in this world. The exam score is primarily determined by the ability to swim. Since 85% of students who can swim have a high exam score, and only 16% of those who cannot swim have a high exam score, the overall probability of a high exam score is higher than that of a low exam score.<|eot_id|>",
