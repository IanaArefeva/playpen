Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. For hospitalized individuals, the correlation between respiratory issues and broken bones is 0.03. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does it mean that respiratory issues does not affect broken bones?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The absence of a direct relationship between the two variables in the hospitalization context does not preclude the possibility of an indirect relationship or a relationship that is not fully accounted for by the hospitalization status.<|eot_id|>",
