The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. We know that the captain's order to execute the prisoner causes the corporal shooting and the private shooting. the corporal shooting and the private shooting causes the prisoner's death. Would the prisoner is dead if the captain's order to release the prisoner instead of the captain's order to execute the prisoner?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The private's action of shooting is also a direct result of the captain's order to execute, not to release. Since the corporal's and the private's actions are not directly caused by the captain's order to release, the chain of causality leading to the prisoner's death is broken, and the prisoner would not be dead if the captain's order was to release the prisoner.||",
