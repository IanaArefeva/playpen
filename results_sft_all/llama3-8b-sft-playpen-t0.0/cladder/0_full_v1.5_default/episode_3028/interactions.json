Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. We know that old age causes high hospital bill. old age and high hospital bill causes recovery. We observed the patient is young.

Since the patient is young and we are considering a scenario where the hospital bill is high instead of the usual low hospital bill, we must carefully examine the chain of cause and effect. The direct relationship between hospital costs and recovery is that higher hospital costs lead to better recovery. In this case, the hospital bill is high, which directly affects the patient's recovery. The patient's age is also a factor that directly affects hospital costs and, by extension, the patient's recovery. Since the patient is young, the high hospital bill directly affects the patient's recovery, leading to a positive outcome.||",
