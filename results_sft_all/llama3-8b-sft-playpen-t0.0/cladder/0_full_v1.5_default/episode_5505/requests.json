The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 3%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 60%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 74%. Is curly hair less likely than straight hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of citrus consumption is only 3%, which means that 97% of the population does not consume citrus. For this 97%, the probability of curly hair is 60%. Since the citrus consumption rate is so low, the overall probability of curly hair is likely to be close to the 60% rate for those not consuming citrus, rather than the higher 74% rate for citrus consumers.<|eot_id|>",
