The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Vaccination status has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on black hair. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on black hair. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of black hair is 32%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of black hair is 38%. For vaccinated individuals, would it be more likely to see black hair if the person had been vaccinated?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of vaccination on black hair is larger than the direct effect of smallpox on black hair, which is negative. The direct effect of smallpox on black hair is also larger than the direct effect of vaccination reaction on black hair, which is positive. Since the direct effect of smallpox on black hair is larger than the direct effect of vaccination on black hair, the overall effect of being vaccinated on black hair is negative.||",
