The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 16%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 44%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 79%. Is freckles less likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Additionally, the direct relationship between birth weight and freckles is also positive, meaning that higher birth weight is associated with higher probability of freckles. Since health condition is unobserved and has a direct effect on both birth weight and freckles, we must consider its potential impact. If health condition is associated with higher birth weight and lower probability of freckles, then the positive relationship between birth weight and freckles could be offset by the negative relationship between health condition and freckles. In this case, the overall probability of freckles might be lower than that of no freckles, especially given the strong positive relationship between maternal smoking and freckles.||",
