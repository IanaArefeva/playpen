The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. For people who are famous, the correlation between attractive appearance and talent is -0.27. If we look at people who are famous, does it mean that attractive appearance does not affect talent?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
