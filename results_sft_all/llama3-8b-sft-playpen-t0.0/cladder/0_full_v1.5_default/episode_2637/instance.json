Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 66%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 29%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 73%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 41%. The overall probability of smoking is 37%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?",
