The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 46%. The probability of vaccine refusal and recovering from the disease is 15%. The probability of getting the vaccine and recovering from the disease is 31%. Is the chance of recovering from the disease larger when observing getting the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of vaccine refusal and recovery is lower than the probability of vaccine and recovery, the chance of recovering from the disease is larger when not observing the vaccine (or in other words, when we condition on vaccine refusal).<|eot_id|>",
