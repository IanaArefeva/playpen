The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 46%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 74%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between jazz and tar deposit is that jazz directly affects the probability of a higher tar deposit. Since the person in question already listens to jazz, we are looking at the counterfactual where they do not. In this counterfactual, the person's probability of a higher tar deposit remains the same, as the direct relationship between jazz and tar deposit is still present. Since the person's probability of a higher tar deposit remains the same, their probability of lung cancer also remains the same, as the direct relationship between a higher tar deposit and lung cancer is still present.||",
