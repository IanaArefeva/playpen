The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 73%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 41%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 66%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 29%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In contrast, the probability of lung cancer for a nonsmoker is 79% with no tar deposit and 49% with high tar deposit. Since the probability of lung cancer is higher for a nonsmoker than for a smoker in both scenarios (with and without high tar deposit), it is not less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
