The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 86%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 48%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 17%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 30%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 52%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 60%. The overall probability of high pollution is 44%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would gene negatively affect lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer for people with and without the smoking gene is not directly compared in the table. The table only shows the probability of lung cancer for different combinations of the gene and smoking behavior, but it does not provide a direct comparison between the two groups (with and without the smoking gene) in the absence of the other variables (smoking and pollution).<|eot_id|>",
