The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 90%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 19%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 69%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The higher probability of high salary among those with a brother (69%) compared to those without a brother (19%) further supports this positive relationship. Since the probability of having a brother is 90%, the overall likelihood of high salary is also higher than that of low salary, given the positive causal chain from having a brother to skill to salary.<|eot_id|>",
