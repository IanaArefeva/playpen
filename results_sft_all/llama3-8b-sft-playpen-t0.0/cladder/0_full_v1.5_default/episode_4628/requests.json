The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 17%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 93%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of dark room is 62%. Is dark room less likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of drinking coffee is 17%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction: (0.17 * 0.62) + (0.83 * 0.93) = 0.1064 + 0.7731 = 0.8795. The probability of bright room is then 1 - 0.8795 = 0.1205. Since 0.8795 is greater than 0.1205, dark room is more likely than bright room overall.<|eot_id|>",
