Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 80%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 34%. Will alarm set by husband decrease the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm ringing is lower when the husband sets the alarm (34%) compared to when he doesn't set the alarm (80%). This suggests that the husband's action of setting the alarm actually decreases the chance of the alarm ringing, rather than increasing it.<|eot_id|>",
