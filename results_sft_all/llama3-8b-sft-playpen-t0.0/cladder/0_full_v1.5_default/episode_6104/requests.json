The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender or in-state residency or competitive department causes brown eyes. We observed the residency is out-of-state. Would the applicant has blue eyes if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the applicant is male, we can conclude that they have brown eyes. The direct relationship between competitive department and brown eyes further solidifies this conclusion. The unobserved residency status does not directly influence the eye color, and the chain of causality from male gender to brown eyes is unbroken.<|eot_id|>",
