The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active and high cigarette tax causes smoking mother. confounder active and smoking mother causes normal infant birth weight. We observed the cigarette tax is high and confounder inactive. Would the infant is born with low weight if smoking mother instead of nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the confounder is active, we can conclude that the relationship between the maternal smoking status and the infant's birth weight is not entirely due to the direct effect of the maternal smoking status on the birth weight. The active confounder also exerts an effect on the birth weight, which means that the birth weight is not entirely determined by the maternal smoking status. In this case, the high cigarette tax still exerts a direct effect on the maternal smoking status, but the active unobserved confounder exerts an effect on both the maternal smoking status and the birth weight. Since the confounder is active and the cigarette tax is high, we can conclude that the birth weight is not entirely determined by the direct effect of the maternal smoking status on the birth weight.
