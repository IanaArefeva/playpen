The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 36%. For individuals who have not visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 61%. For individuals who have visited England and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 59%. For individuals who have visited England and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 83%. For individuals who have not visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 68%. For individuals who have not visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 45%. For individuals who have visited England and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 79%. For individuals who have visited England and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 27%. The overall probability of high skill level is 3%. Does having visited England positively affect salary through occupation?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of white-collar job is higher for those who have not visited England and have high skill levels (45%) than for those who have not visited England and have low skill levels (68%). This suggests that skill is a more important factor than visiting England in determining occupation. Since occupation has a direct effect on salary, and the probability of white-collar job is higher for those who have not visited England and have high skill levels, it is likely that the positive effect of having high skill on occupation is driving the positive effect of having high skill on salary, rather than the positive effect of having visited England on occupation.||",
