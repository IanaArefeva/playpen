The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 50%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 39%. For students who are encouraged, would it be more likely to see high exam score if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that encouragement actually hinders exam performance in this world, rather than helping it. If a student who is encouraged still manages to achieve a high exam score, it would be against the established pattern and would imply that the student's exam score is not directly related to their encouragement level.<|eot_id|>",
