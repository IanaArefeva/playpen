The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 56%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. For obese people, would it be more likely to see long lifespan if the person had been normal weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, the probability of a long lifespan is higher for obese people (70%) than for normal weight people (56%). This suggests that the positive effect of being normal weight on long lifespan is overwhelmed by the positive effect of being obese on long lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
