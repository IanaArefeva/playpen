The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 61%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 45%. For students who are encouraged, would it be less likely to see high exam score if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that encouragement actually leads to a lower exam score in this world, which is counterintuitive. If we consider the direct effect of encouragement on exam score, we see that encouragement directly leads to a lower exam score. This means that the positive effect of encouragement on exam score through studying habits is overwhelmed by its direct negative effect, leading to a lower exam score for encouraged students.<|eot_id|>",
