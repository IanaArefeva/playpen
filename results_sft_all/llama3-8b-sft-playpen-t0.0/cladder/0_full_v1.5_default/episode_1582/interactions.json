The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 34%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 73%. Will the captain's order to execute the prisoner decrease the chance of the prisoner's death?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
