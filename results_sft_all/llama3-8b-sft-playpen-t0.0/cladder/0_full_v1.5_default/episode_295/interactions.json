The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 56%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 24%. For days when Alice wakes up late, would it be less likely to see arriving to school on time if Alice had gotten up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key point here is that the probability of arriving on time is lower when she wakes up late, but this does not imply that she would be more likely to arrive on time if she woke up on time. The two scenarios are distinct and separate, and the probability of arriving on time is not directly dependent on the counterfactual condition of waking up late. In other words, the probability of arriving on time is higher when she wakes up on time, but this does not imply that she would be more likely to arrive on time if she woke up late.||",
