The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 18%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and high infant mortality is 26%. The probability of smoking mother and high infant mortality is 10%. Is the chance of high infant mortality larger when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since health condition is unobserved, we must consider its potential impact on the relationship between maternal smoking and infant mortality. The probability of high infant mortality given a smoking mother is 10%, and the probability of high infant mortality given a nonsmoking mother is 26%. The difference in these probabilities (26% - 10% = 16%) might lead one to conclude that the chance of high infant mortality is larger when observing a smoking mother. However, we must consider the joint effect of health condition and maternal smoking on infant mortality. If health condition has a strong direct effect on infant mortality, it could potentially counteract the effect of maternal smoking, leading to a lower overall probability of high infant mortality when a mother smokes. In this case, the observed difference in probabilities might not accurately reflect the true relationship between maternal smoking and infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
