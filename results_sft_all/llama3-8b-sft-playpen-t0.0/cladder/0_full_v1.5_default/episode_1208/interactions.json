The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 18%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and high infant mortality is 26%. The probability of smoking mother and high infant mortality is 10%. Is the chance of high infant mortality larger when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

          "content": "No\nThe direct effect of maternal smoking on infant's birth weight and infant mortality is present, but the direct effect of health condition on both birth weight and infant mortality is also present. Since health condition is unobserved, we must consider its potential impact on the relationship between maternal smoking and infant mortality. The probability of high infant mortality given a smoking mother is 10%, and the probability of high infant mortality given a nonsmoking mother is 26%. The difference in these probabilities (26% - 10% = 16%) might lead one to conclude that the chance of high infant mortality is larger when observing a smoking mother. However, we must consider the joint effect of health condition and maternal smoking on infant mortality. If health condition has a strong direct effect on infant mortality, it could potentially counteract the effect of maternal smoking, leading to a lower overall probability of high infant mortality when a mother smokes. In this case, the observed difference in probabilities might not accurately reflect the true relationship between maternal smoking and infant mortality.||",
