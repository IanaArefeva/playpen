The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 47%. For patients who pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 24%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 67%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of a high hospital bill is 47%, this means that almost half of the patients will have higher hospital costs, which in turn will lead to a higher probability of recovery. In this context, the overall probability of recovery is likely to be higher than that of non-recovery, as the positive effect of higher hospital costs on recovery will likely outweigh the negative effect of lower hospital costs on recovery.<|eot_id|>",
