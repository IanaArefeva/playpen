The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of solar eclipse is 33%. The probability of no solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 46%. The probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 12%. Is the chance of arriving to school on time larger when observing solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of no solar eclipse is higher than the probability of solar eclipse, and the probability of no solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is higher than the probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time, it is more likely that Alice will arrive to school on time when there is no solar eclipse.<|eot_id|>",
