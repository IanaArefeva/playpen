The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of having a brother is 97%. The probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival is 1%. The probability of having a brother and smallpox survival is 52%. Is the chance of smallpox survival larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having a brother and smallpox survival is 52%, which is lower than the probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival (1%).\n2. The probability of having a brother is 97%, which means that in 97% of the cases, the person has a brother. This high probability of having a brother does not directly translate to a higher probability of smallpox survival.\n3. The direct effect of having a brother on smallpox survival is not clear from the given information. The direct effect of having a brother is on vaccination reaction and smallpox, not directly on smallpox survival.\n4. The direct effect of smallpox on smallpox survival is clear, and the probability of smallpox survival is higher when not having a brother (1% vs. 52%).\n5. The direct effect of vaccination reaction on smallpox survival is also clear, and the probability of smallpox survival is higher when not having a brother (1% vs. 52%).\n6. The joint probability of having a brother and smallpox survival is 52%, which is lower than the probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival (1%).\n7. The joint probability of having a brother and smallpox survival is lower than the probability of not having a brother and smallpox survival, which suggests that",
