The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 19%. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 59%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 60%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 99%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 26%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 37%. For managers who sign termination letters, would it be less likely to see employee being fired if the manager had signed the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the employee being fired when the manager and director both sign the termination letter is 99%. In the absence of the manager's signature, the probability of the director signing the termination letter is 26%. In this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 60%. Since 99% is higher than 60%, it is less likely to see the employee being fired if the manager had signed the termination letter.\nHowever, we need to consider the joint probability of the manager and director both signing the termination letter. The probability of the manager signing the termination letter is 37%, and the probability of the director signing the termination letter given that the manager has already done so is also 37%. This joint probability is 37% * 37% = 13.69%. In the absence of the manager's signature, the probability of the director signing the termination letter is 26%. The probability of the manager not signing the termination letter is 63% (100% - 37%). The joint probability of the manager not signing and the director signing is 63% * 26% = 16.38%. Since 16.38% is less than 13.69%, it is less likely to see the manager and director both sign the termination letter if the manager had not already done so.",
