The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender and in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender or in-state residency or competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the residency is out-of-state. Would the applicant gets admitted if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that in-state residency is the cause of competitive department, and we also know that male gender is associated with in-state residency, we can conclude that male gender is not the direct cause of competitive department in this setting. The direct cause of competitive department is in-state residency. If we consider a non-male gender, we still have the in-state residency as the direct cause of competitive department. Since the direct cause of competitive department is in-state residency, and we already know that in-state residency is associated with competitive department, we can conclude that the non-male gender will still lead to a competitive department. Finally, since male gender or in-state residency or competitive department is associated with admission acceptance, and we already know that in-state residency is associated with competitive department, we can conclude that the non-male gender will still lead to admission acceptance.<|eot_id|>",
