Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 60%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 44%. Will encouragement decrease the chance of high exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This positive direct effect on studying habits could counteract the negative direct effect of encouragement on exam score, leading to a net positive effect of encouragement on exam score.<|eot_id|>",
