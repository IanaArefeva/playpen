The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that solar eclipse or heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is heavy traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school late if no solar eclipse instead of solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
