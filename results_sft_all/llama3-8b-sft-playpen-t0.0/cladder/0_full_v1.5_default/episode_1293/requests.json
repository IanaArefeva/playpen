The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 71%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 33%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The additional information about the relationship between tar deposit and lung cancer does not change the fact that the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is already present in the base probabilities. The increase in the probability of lung cancer when there is a high tar deposit is a result of the direct effect of tar deposit on lung cancer, not a result of the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer. Since the direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is already present in the base probabilities, the additional information about the relationship between tar deposit and lung cancer does not change the fact that the probability of lung cancer for a smoker is higher than for a nonsmoker, even if the person had been a nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
