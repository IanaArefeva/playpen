The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that intelligent parents or confounder active causes high parental social status. intelligent parents and confounder active and high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder active. Would the child is not intelligent if unintelligent parents instead of intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that intelligent parents lead to both higher social status and higher child intelligence, and we also know that the confounder active condition is present, we can conclude that the child will still be intelligent even if the parents are not intelligent. The direct link between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence is distinct from the link between parents' social status and child's intelligence, so the child's intelligence is not dependent on the parents' intelligence in this specific scenario.||",
