The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 27%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 94%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 6%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 67%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 50%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 14%. Does smoking negatively affect college admission through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The table only shows that being a smoker affects the probability of being hard-working, and that being hard-working affects the probability of college admission. The direct relationship between smoking and college admission is through the intermediate variable \"effort\" only in the sense that being a smoker affects the probability of being hard-working, which in turn affects the probability of college admission.||",
