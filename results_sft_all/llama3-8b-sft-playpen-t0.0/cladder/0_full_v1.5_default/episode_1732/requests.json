Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 42%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 76%. Will waking up late decrease the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This directly indicates that waking up late is associated with a higher chance of arriving to school on time, rather than a decrease.<|eot_id|>",
