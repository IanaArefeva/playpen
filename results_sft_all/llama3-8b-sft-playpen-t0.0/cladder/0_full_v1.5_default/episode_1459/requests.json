Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 74%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 21%. For husbands that set the alarm, would it be less likely to see ringing alarm if the husband had not set the alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that setting the alarm actually decreases the likelihood of the alarm clock ringing, from 74% to 21%. If the husband had not set the alarm, the probability of the alarm clock ringing would still be 74%, which is higher than the 21% probability when the husband sets the alarm.<|eot_id|>",
