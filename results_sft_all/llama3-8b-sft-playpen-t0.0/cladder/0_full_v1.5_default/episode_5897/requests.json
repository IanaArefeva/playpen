The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a brother and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Having a brother has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 32%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 50%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of having a brother is 46%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of having a brother is 76%. Will having a brother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of having a brother on normal infant birth weight is positive, but this positive effect is likely to be overwhelmed by the negative effect of the unobserved confounders, which is not accounted for in the given data. The correct approach is to control for the unobserved confounders and the intervening variable \"cigarette tax\" to isolate the direct effect of having a brother on normal infant birth weight.<|eot_id|>",
