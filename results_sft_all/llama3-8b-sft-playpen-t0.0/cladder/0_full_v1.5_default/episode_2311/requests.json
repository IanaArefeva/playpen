The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 81%. The probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 11%. The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 62%. Is the chance of long lifespan larger when observing obesity?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of obesity is 81%, and the probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 11%, we can conclude that the chance of long lifespan is larger when not observing obesity.<|eot_id|>",
