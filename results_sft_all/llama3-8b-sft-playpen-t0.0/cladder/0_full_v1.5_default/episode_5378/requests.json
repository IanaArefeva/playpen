The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 9%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 86%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 48%. Is being lactose intolerant less likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of intelligent parents is 9%, we can weight the probabilities by this fraction: (0.09 * 0.48) + (0.91 * 0.86) = 0.0432 + 0.7854 = 0.8286. This is higher than 0.5, so being lactose intolerant is more likely than not being lactose intolerant overall.<|eot_id|>",
