The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 79%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 48%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between effort and college admission is that higher effort leads to higher college admission rates. Since the question is about the counterfactual scenario of a smoker being a nonsmoker, we need to consider the chain of cause and effect. If a smoker were a nonsmoker, their college admission probability would still be 79% (the probability for nonsmokers), not higher than the 48% probability for smokers. This is because the direct effect of being a nonsmoker on college admission is separate from the direct effect of being a smoker on college admission. The chain of cause and effect is: being a smoker affects college admission, and being a nonsmoker affects college admission, but there is no direct link between being a smoker and being a nonsmoker that would change the college admission probability.||",
