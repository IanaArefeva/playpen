The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 71%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 31%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 85%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 47%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 91%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The table below organizes the different scenarios and their associated probabilities of the employee being fired:\n\n|  | M signs T  | M doesn't sign T  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| C fires E  | 47%  | 85%  |\n| C doesn't fire E  | 0%  | 0%  |\n\nThe table above shows that when the manager signs the termination letter (M signs T), the probability of the employee being fired is lower than when the manager doesn't sign the letter (M doesn't sign T), in both scenarios where the CEO fires the employee (C fires E) and where the CEO doesn't fire the employee (C doesn't fire E). This pattern holds across all four scenarios, which suggests that the manager's action of signing the termination letter is associated with a lower probability of the employee being fired.<|eot_id|>",
