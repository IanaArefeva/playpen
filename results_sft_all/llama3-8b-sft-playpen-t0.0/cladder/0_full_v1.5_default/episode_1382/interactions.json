The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 10%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 43%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of being a smoker is 10%, and the probability of being a nonsmoker is 90%. The probability of lung cancer among smokers is 64%, and the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers is 43%. The overall probability of lung cancer is (0.1 * 0.64) + (0.9 * 0.43) = 0.064 + 0.387 = 0.451. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.451 = 0.549. Since 0.549 is greater than 0.451, lung cancer is less likely than absence of lung cancer overall.||",
