The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 59%. The probability of vaccine refusal and recovering from the disease is 24%. The probability of getting the vaccine and recovering from the disease is 20%. Is the chance of recovering from the disease smaller when observing getting the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
