The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to retain the employee. Would the employee is not fired if not having visited England instead of having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The primary cause is the CEO's decision to fire the employee, which directly affects both the director and the employee. The having visited England condition is an intervening cause that mediates the relationship between the CEO's decision and the employee's fate. If the CEO had not made the decision to fire the employee, the entire chain of events leading to the employee's being fired would not have occurred, and the having visited England condition would not have materialized. In this scenario, the absence of having visited England would not change the outcome of the CEO's decision, which is the primary driver of the employee's fate.||",
