The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 33%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 49%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 77%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 44%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 71%. The overall probability of smoking is 12%. Does smoking positively affect peanut allergy through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To establish whether there is a positive effect of smoking on peanut allergy through tar deposit, we need to examine the joint probability of being a smoker and having a high tar deposit, and then check if this joint probability is associated with a higher probability of being allergic to peanuts compared to the joint probability of being a nonsmoker and having a high tar deposit.\nGiven that the probability of being a smoker is 12%, and the probability of having a high tar deposit is 64% for smokers, we can conclude that the joint probability of being a smoker and having a high tar deposit is 12% * 64% = 7.68%. In this case, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 71%, which is higher than the probability of being allergic to peanuts when there is no tar deposit (44%).\nNext, we need to examine the joint probability of being a nonsmoker and having a high tar deposit. Since the probability of being a nonsmoker is 88% (1 - 0.12), and the probability of having a high tar deposit is 33% for nonsmokers, we can conclude that the joint probability of being a nonsmoker and having a high tar deposit is 88% * 33% = 29.04%. In this case, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 77",
