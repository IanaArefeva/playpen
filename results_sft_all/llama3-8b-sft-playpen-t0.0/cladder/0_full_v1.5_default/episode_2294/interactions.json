The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 88%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 67%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between effort and college admission is that higher effort leads to higher college admission probability. Since the direct relationship between smoking and college admission is negative, and the direct relationship between effort and college admission is positive, we can conclude that for smokers, it is less likely to see college admission than for nonsmokers, not more likely.||",
