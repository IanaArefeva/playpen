The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 45%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 67%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 30%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 23%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 44%. The overall probability of smoking is 50%. Does smoking positively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
