Treatment has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of receives treatment is 55%. The probability of receives no treatment and being allergic to peanuts is 14%. The probability of receives treatment and being allergic to peanuts is 39%. Is the chance of being allergic to peanuts smaller when observing receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
