The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of male gender is 13%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 51%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 45%. Is being lactose intolerant less likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The net effect is that being male still has a lower probability of being lactose intolerant than being non-male, which is the opposite of the statement that being lactose intolerant is less likely than not being lactose intolerant.||",
