The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Method 1: We look directly at how smoking correlates with lung cancer in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to tar deposit. To understand how smoking affects lung cancer, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this case, looking at the relationship between smoking and lung cancer on a case-by-case basis according to the intervening variable (tar deposit) can help us control for the confounding effect of the intermediate variable and more directly identify the relationship between the cause (smoking) and the effect (lung cancer). This is an example of using instrumental variables to control for confounding, which is a common technique in causal inference.<|eot_id|>",
