Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 5%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 16%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 66%. Is tanned skin less likely than pale skin overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of tanned skin is 16% for those not using tanning salons and 66% for those who do, which still far exceeds the 5% probability of tanning salon use. The overall probability of tanned skin is the sum of the products of the individual probabilities: (0.05 * 0.66) + (0.95 * 0.16) = 0.033 + 0.152 = 0.185. In comparison, the probability of pale skin is 1 - 0.185 = 0.815, which is lower than the probability of tanned skin.<|eot_id|>",
