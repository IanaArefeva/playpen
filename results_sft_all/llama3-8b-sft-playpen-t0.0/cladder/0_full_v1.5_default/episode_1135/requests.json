The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 75%. The probability of receives no treatment and recovery is 18%. The probability of receives treatment and recovery is 33%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The difference between these two probabilities is 15%, which is not larger than the difference between the probability of \"receiving no treatment\" (25%) and the probability of \"receiving no treatment and recovery\" (18%). This suggests that the chance of recovery is not larger when observing \"receiving treatment\".<|eot_id|>",
