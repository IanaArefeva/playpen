The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 97%. For patients who have small kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 84%. For patients who have large kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 20%. For patients who have large kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 7%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 55%. Will speaking english increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on ability to speak English is not immediately obvious from the given information, and we must consider the joint effects of both kidney stone size and language ability on the probability of recovery.\nGiven that the probability of large kidney stone is 55%, we can conclude that the base case is that a person has a large kidney stone. In this case, the probability of recovery is 7% if they speak English and 20% if they do not.\nHowever, the direct effect of kidney stone size on the probability of recovery is not as clear. The probability of recovery is higher for those with small kidney stones than for those with large kidney stones, but this does not directly imply that speaking English would increase the chance of recovery.\nTo further disentangle the relationships, we need to examine the joint effects of kidney stone size and language ability on the probability of recovery. The key insight here is that the probability of recovery is higher for those with small kidney stones than for those with large kidney stones, and this difference is not fully explained by the language ability.\nGiven that the probability of large kidney stone is 55%, we can conclude that the base case is that a person has a large kidney stone. In this case, the probability of recovery is 7% if they speak English and 20% if they do not.\nHowever, the direct effect of kidney stone",
