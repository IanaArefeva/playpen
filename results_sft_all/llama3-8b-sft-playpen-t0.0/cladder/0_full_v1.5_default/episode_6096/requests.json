The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes brown eyes. We observed the residency is out-of-state. Would the applicant has brown eyes if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that the applicant is out of state and that in-state residency is a cause of competitive department, we can conclude that the applicant is in a competitive department. The direct relationship between competitive department and brown eyes is also established. Since the applicant is male and in a competitive department, we can conclude that the applicant has brown eyes. If the applicant were non-male, we would still conclude that they are in a competitive department (since in-state residency is a cause of competitive department and the applicant is out of state) and that they have brown eyes (since male is not a necessary condition for brown eyes in this system).<|eot_id|>",
