The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes brown eyes. We observed the residency is out-of-state. Would the applicant has brown eyes if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that the applicant is out of state and that in-state residency is a cause of competitive department, we can conclude that the applicant is in a competitive department. The direct relationship between competitive department and brown eyes is also established. Since the applicant is male and in a competitive department, we can conclude that the applicant has brown eyes. If the applicant were non-male, we would still conclude that they are in a competitive department (since in-state residency is a cause of competitive department and the applicant is out of state) and that they have brown eyes (since male is not a necessary condition for brown eyes in this system).||",
