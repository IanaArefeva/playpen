The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 91%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 83%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 56%. Is curly hair more likely than straight hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the majority of the population (91%) has a lower probability of curly hair (56%) compared to those who do not consume citrus (83%). Since the overall probability of citrus consumption is so high, the overall probability of curly hair will be lower than the probability of straight hair, which is the default state for those not consuming citrus.<|eot_id|>",
