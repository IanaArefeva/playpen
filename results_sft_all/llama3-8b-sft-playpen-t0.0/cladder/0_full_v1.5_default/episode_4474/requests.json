Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 2%. The probability of not listening to jazz and lung cancer is 27%. The probability of listening to jazz and lung cancer is 1%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing listening to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In comparison, the probability of lung cancer given no jazz is 27% (P(Lung Cancer|Not Jazz) = 27%). This difference in probabilities suggests that the chance of lung cancer is larger when not observing jazz.<|eot_id|>",
