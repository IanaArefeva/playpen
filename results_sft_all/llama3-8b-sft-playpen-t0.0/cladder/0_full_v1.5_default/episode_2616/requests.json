The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 45%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 75%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 92%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of smoking is 45%, this means that 55% of the population is not smoking. For this 55%, the probability of lung cancer is 75%, which is lower than the 92% probability of lung cancer among smokers. This suggests that the overall risk of lung cancer is lower than the risk of absence of lung cancer, especially since the 45% of the population that smokes already has a higher risk of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
