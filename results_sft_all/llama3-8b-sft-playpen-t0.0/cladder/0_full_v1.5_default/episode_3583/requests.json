The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 30%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 50%. For people who have a brother, would it be less likely to see smallpox survival if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of smallpox survival is higher for people who have a brother (50%) than for those who do not (30%). This difference in probability is not directly related to the person's vaccination reaction or the occurrence of smallpox. The separate direct relationships imply that having a brother still leads to a higher probability of smallpox survival, even if the person does not have a brother.<|eot_id|>",
