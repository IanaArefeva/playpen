The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. We know that speaking english and smoker causes having diabetes. speaking english or smoker or having diabetes causes long lifespan. We observed the person is a smoker. Would the person has a short lifespan if not speaking english instead of speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If the person were not speaking English, it would not change the fact that they are a smoker, and therefore would still have a short lifespan.||",
