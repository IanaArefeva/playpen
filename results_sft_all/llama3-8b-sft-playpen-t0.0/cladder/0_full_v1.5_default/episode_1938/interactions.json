The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drug taken and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on drug taken. Drug taken has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 39%. The probability of not taking of any assigned drugs and low cholesterol is 30%. The probability of taking of all assigned drugs and low cholesterol is 17%. Is the chance of low cholesterol larger when observing taking of all assigned drugs?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
