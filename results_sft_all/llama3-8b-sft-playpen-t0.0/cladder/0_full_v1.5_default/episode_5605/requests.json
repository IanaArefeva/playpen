The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 60%. For patients who pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 39%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 62%. Is thick lips less likely than thin lips overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of thick lips is higher for those who pay a high hospital bill than for those who pay a low hospital bill, which suggests that hospital costs are associated with thick lips. Since hospital costs are also associated with hospital bill, we need to control for hospital costs to disentangle the relationship between hospital bill and thick lips. If we condition on hospital costs, we find that the probability of thick lips is higher for those who pay a high hospital bill than for those who pay a low hospital bill, which means that hospital bill is associated with thick lips. This association between hospital bill and thick lips is not due to a direct relationship between hospital bill and thick lips, but rather because hospital bill is a proxy for hospital costs, which in turn is associated with thick lips.<|eot_id|>",
