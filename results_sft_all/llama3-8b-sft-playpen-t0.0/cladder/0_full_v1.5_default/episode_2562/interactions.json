The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 94%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 52%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 32%. Is high infant mortality more likely than low infant mortality overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of high infant mortality is lower for infants with smoking mothers (32%) than for those with nonsmoking mothers (52%), we can conclude that the higher birth weight associated with smoking mothers leads to lower infant mortality. This counteracts the direct positive relationship between health condition and both birth weight and infant's mortality, which would otherwise imply higher infant mortality for those with health condition. The overall probability of high infant mortality is lower than that of low infant mortality, which is 48% (100% - 52% for nonsmoking and 32% for smoking).||",
