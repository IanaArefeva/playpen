The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking gene is 8%. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 49%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 53%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of having a smoking gene is 8%, we can use this information to calculate the overall probability of lung cancer. The overall probability of lung cancer is a weighted average of the probabilities of lung cancer for people with and without smoking genes, where the weights are the probabilities of having a smoking and a nonsmoking gene, respectively. The probability of having a smoking gene is 0.08, and the probability of having a nonsmoking gene is 0.92. The overall probability of lung cancer is then (0.08 * 0.53) + (0.92 * 0.49) = 0.0424 + 0.4528 = 0.4952. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.4952 = 0.5048. Since 0.4952 is less than 0.5048, lung cancer is less likely than absence of lung cancer overall.||",
