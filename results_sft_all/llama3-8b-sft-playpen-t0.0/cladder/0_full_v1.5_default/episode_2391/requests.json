The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 57%. The probability of reduced supply and increased price is 20%. The probability of increased supply and increased price is 43%. Is the chance of increased price larger when observing increased supply?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the joint probability of \"reduced supply\" and \"increased price\" is lower than the joint probability of \"increased supply\" and \"increased price\", we can conclude that the chance of \"increased price\" is larger when observing \"increased supply\" than when observing \"reduced supply\".<|eot_id|>",
