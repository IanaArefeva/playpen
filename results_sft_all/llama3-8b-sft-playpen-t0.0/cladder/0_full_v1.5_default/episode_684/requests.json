The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of encouragement is 45%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 21%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 87%. Is high exam score less likely than low exam score overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The higher probability of a high exam score among those who are encouraged (87%) compared to those who are not (21%) further solidifies this positive relationship. Since encouragement is more likely than not (45% vs. 55%), and it directly affects exam score, we can conclude that high exam score is more likely than not.<|eot_id|>",
