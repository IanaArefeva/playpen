The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 2%. The probability of nonsmoking and college admission is 67%. The probability of smoking and college admission is 1%. Is the chance of college admission larger when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of effort on college admission is positive, but the overall probability of college admission is still lower when smoking (1%) than when not smoking (67%). Since the direct negative effect of smoking on college admission outweighs the positive effect of effort, the chance of college admission is larger when not observing smoking.<|eot_id|>",
