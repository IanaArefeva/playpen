The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of having a brother is 41%. The probability of not having a brother and recovery is 42%. The probability of having a brother and recovery is 10%. Is the chance of recovery smaller when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of having a brother is 41%, and the probability of not having a brother and still recovering is 42%. This means that the probability of not having a brother is 59%. The probability of having a brother and not recovering is 31% (100% - 10% - 59%). The probability of not having a brother and not recovering is 9% (100% - 42% - 10% - 31%). The direct relationship between having a brother and recovery is not the only relationship at play here, and the probability of not having a brother is higher than the probability of having a brother.<|eot_id|>",
