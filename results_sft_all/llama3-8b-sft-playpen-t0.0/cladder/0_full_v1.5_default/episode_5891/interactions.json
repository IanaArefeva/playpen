The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a brother and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Having a brother has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a brother is 26%. The probability of not having a brother and normal infant birth weight is 23%. The probability of having a brother and normal infant birth weight is 14%. Is the chance of normal infant birth weight larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between having a brother and normal infant birth weight is positive, but the unobserved confounder exerts a negative effect on both having a brother and normal infant birth weight. Since the unobserved confounder is unobserved, we can conclude that the chance of normal infant birth weight is not larger when observing having a brother.||",
