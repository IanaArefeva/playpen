The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how gene correlates with lung cancer case by case according to smoking. Method 2: We look directly at how gene correlates with lung cancer in general. To understand how gene affects lung cancer, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In Method 1, the direct relationship between the gene and lung cancer is being confounded by the unobserved but direct relationship between the gene and the unobserved \"pollution\" variable, which in turn affects both the gene and the lung cancer. In Method 2, the direct relationship between the gene and lung cancer is being confounded by the unobserved \"pollution\" variable, which has a direct relationship with both the gene and the lung cancer. In both cases, the unobserved \"pollution\" variable is the confounding variable that needs to be accounted for to establish a clear causal relationship between the gene and lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
