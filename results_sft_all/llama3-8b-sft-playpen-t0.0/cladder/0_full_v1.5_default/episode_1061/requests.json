The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 4%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 25%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 76%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 98%. The overall probability of male gender is 59%. Will receives treatment decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of male gender is higher than the probability of not male (41%), and the probability of recovery for male patients not receiving treatment is higher than the probability of recovery for not male patients not receiving treatment (4%). This suggests that male patients are more likely to recover than not male patients, and that this difference is not fully explained by the absence of treatment.<|eot_id|>",
