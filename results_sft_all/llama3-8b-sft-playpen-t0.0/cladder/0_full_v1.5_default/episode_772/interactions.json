The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of high salary is 37%. For individuals who are male, the probability of high salary is 73%. Will male gender increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between male gender and occupation is also a direct one, and occupation has a direct effect on salary. Since the probability of high salary is higher for male than for female, we need to consider the joint effect of male gender and occupation on the probability of high salary. If male gender leads to a higher probability of being in a higher occupation, and that higher occupation in turn leads to a higher probability of high salary, then male gender could still lead to a higher probability of high salary, even if the direct relationship between male gender and high salary is not the only relationship at play.||",
