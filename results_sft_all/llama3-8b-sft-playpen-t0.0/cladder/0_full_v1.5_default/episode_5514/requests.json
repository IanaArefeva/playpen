The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of citrus intake is 13%. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 61%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 45%. Is curly hair more likely than straight hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that only a fraction of the total population (13%) has a higher chance of having curly hair. The remaining 87% of the population, who do not consume citrus, have a lower chance of having curly hair (61%). Since the fraction of the population that has a higher chance of having curly hair is less than half of the total population, we conclude that, overall, straight hair is more likely than curly hair.<|eot_id|>",
