The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 83%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 48%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 74%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 56%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 83%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high tar deposit for a smoker is 83%. Since the probability of high tar deposit is higher than the probability of no tar deposit, the overall probability of lung cancer for a smoker is more likely to be higher than the probability of lung cancer for a nonsmoker, who has a 42% chance of lung cancer with no tar deposit and an 83% chance with high tar deposit. The higher probability of high tar deposit among smokers further tilts the balance in their favor, making it less likely for a smoker to have lower lung cancer risk than a nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
