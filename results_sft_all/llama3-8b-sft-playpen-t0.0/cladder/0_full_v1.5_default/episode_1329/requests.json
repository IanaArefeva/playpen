The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking gene is 3%. The probability of nonsmoking gene and lung cancer is 50%. The probability of smoking gene and lung cancer is 2%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing smoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The \"smoking\" condition is already a direct cause of \"lung cancer\", and the \"gene\" condition is a separate cause of \"smoking\" that does not directly reduce the likelihood of \"lung cancer\" when \"smoking\" is present.<|eot_id|>",
