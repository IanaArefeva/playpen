The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 36%. For children who do not like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 39%. For children who like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 68%. For children who like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 67%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 56%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 55%. For children who like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 8%. For children who like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 24%. The overall probability of confounder active is 42%. Does liking spicy food positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The unobserved \"conflater\" could also play a role in this relationship. The probability of intelligent child is higher for children who like spicy food and have high parental social status than for children who like spicy food and have low parental social status, which might indicate that the direct relationship between parents' social status and child's intelligence is not the only path through which parents' social status could influence child's intelligence. The unobserved \"conflater\" could also play a role in this relationship.<|eot_id|>",
