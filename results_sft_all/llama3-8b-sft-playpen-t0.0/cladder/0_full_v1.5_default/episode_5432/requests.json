Effort has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of smoking is 87%. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 53%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 39%. Is freckles more likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Additionally, the direct relationship between effort and freckles is that higher effort is associated with a lower probability of freckles. Since the probability of smoking is 87%, the large majority of the population is smokers, and among them, the probability of freckles is lower than among nonsmokers. This suggests that the overall probability of freckles is likely lower than the probability of no freckles, given the higher base rate of smoking and its associated lower probability of freckles.<|eot_id|>",
