The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 52%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 44%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of clean water is 54%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of clean water is 26%. Will clean water decrease the chance of cholera contraction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, we also need to consider the relationship between the water company and water quality, as the water company has a direct effect on water quality. In this case, the local water company is associated with a higher probability of clean water (54%) than the global water company (26%). This suggests that the local water company is more likely to provide clean water than the global water company. Since the probability of clean water is higher for the local water company, and the probability of cholera contraction is lower for the local water company (52% compared to 44% for the global water company), we can conclude that clean water does not directly decrease the chance of cholera contraction.<|eot_id|>",
