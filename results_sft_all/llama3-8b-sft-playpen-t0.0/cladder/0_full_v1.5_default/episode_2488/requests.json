The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 99%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 88%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 23%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 9%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 59%. Will receives treatment decrease the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
