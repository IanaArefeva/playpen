Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 4%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 26%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 77%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 98%. The overall probability of male gender is 56%.
