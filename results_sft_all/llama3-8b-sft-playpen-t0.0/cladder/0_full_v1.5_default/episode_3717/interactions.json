The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 60%. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 54%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 83%. Is black hair more likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Additionally, the probability of black hair is higher than that of college degree or higher (83% vs 60%). This suggests that black hair is more likely than college degree or higher. In the absence of any direct relationship between college degree and black hair, we must consider the joint probability of college degree and black hair. The joint probability of college degree and black hair is 0.5 * 0.83 = 0.415, which is less than the probability of black hair (0.54) among those without a college degree. This indicates that black hair is more likely than college degree or higher, and by extension, more likely than college degree and black hair.||",
