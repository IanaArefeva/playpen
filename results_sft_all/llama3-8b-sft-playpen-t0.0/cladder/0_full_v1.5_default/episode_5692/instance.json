Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 88%. The probability of not having a sister and high infant mortality is 10%. The probability of having a sister and high infant mortality is 56%. Is the chance of high infant mortality larger when observing having a sister?",
