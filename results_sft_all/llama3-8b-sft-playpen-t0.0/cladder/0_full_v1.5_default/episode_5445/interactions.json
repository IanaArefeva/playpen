The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 81%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. Will playing card games decrease the chance of long lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only direct relationship that is established is between diabetes and lifespan, which shows that diabetes has a negative effect on lifespan. Since the probability of long lifespan is lower for people who play card games than for those who do not, it can be concluded that card game play has a negative effect on long lifespan.||",
