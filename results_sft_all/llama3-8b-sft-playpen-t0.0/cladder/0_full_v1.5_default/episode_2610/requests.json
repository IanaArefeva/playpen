The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 78%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 28%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 76%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 34%. The overall probability of smoking is 63%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer is higher for both smokers and nonsmokers when there is a high tar deposit. This suggests that the primary risk factor for lung cancer is not smoking per se, but rather the presence of a high tar deposit. Since the probability of high tar deposit is lower for smokers (28%) than for nonsmokers (78%), and the probability of lung cancer is higher for both groups when there is a high tar deposit, it can be concluded that smoking does not directly decrease the chance of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
