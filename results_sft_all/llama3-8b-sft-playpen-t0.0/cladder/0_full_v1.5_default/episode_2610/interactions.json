The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 78%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 28%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 76%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 34%. The overall probability of smoking is 63%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer is higher for both smokers and nonsmokers when there is a high tar deposit. This suggests that the primary risk factor for lung cancer is not smoking per se, but rather the presence of a high tar deposit. Since the probability of high tar deposit is lower for smokers (28%) than for nonsmokers (78%), and the probability of lung cancer is higher for both groups when there is a high tar deposit, it can be concluded that smoking does not directly decrease the chance of lung cancer.||",
