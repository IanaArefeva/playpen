Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of encouragement is 7%. The probability of discouragement and high exam score is 31%. The probability of encouragement and high exam score is 5%.

This means that only a small fraction of the encouragement cases lead to a high exam score. In contrast, the probability of discouragement and high exam score is 31%, which is a much larger fraction. This suggests that the chance of a high exam score is not larger when observing encouragement, but rather when observing discouragement.<|eot_id|>",
