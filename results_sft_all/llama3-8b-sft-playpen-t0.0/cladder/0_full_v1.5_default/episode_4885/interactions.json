The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on black hair. Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 93%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of black hair is 76%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of black hair is 28%. Is black hair less likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only scenario where the probability of black hair is lower than the probability of blond hair is when people use tanning salon treatments (28% vs. 72%).
