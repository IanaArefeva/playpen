The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Personality has a direct effect on relationship status. Appearance has a direct effect on relationship status. The overall probability of kindness is 84%. For people with mean personalities, the probability of attractive appearance is 56%. For people with kind personalities, the probability of attractive appearance is 56%. Is attractive appearance more likely than unattractive appearance overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
