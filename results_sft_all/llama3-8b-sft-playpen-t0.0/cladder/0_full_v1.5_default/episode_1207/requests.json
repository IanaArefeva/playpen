The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 8%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 42%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 59%. Is high infant mortality less likely than low infant mortality overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since health condition is unobserved, we must consider its potential impact on the relationship between birth weight and infant mortality. If health condition has a positive effect on birth weight and a negative effect on infant mortality, then the positive direct effect of birth weight on infant mortality could be offset by the negative indirect effect of health condition on infant mortality through birth weight. This would imply that the overall probability of high infant mortality might not be less than that of low infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
