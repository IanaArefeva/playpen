The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 23%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 71%. For people who went to tanning salons, would it be less likely to see large feet if the person had not had a tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of large feet among those who used tanning salon treatments is 71%, which is higher than the 23% among those who did not use tanning salon treatments.
