The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of male gender is 16%. The probability of non-male gender and being lactose intolerant is 51%. The probability of male gender and being lactose intolerant is 1%. Is the chance of being lactose intolerant larger when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Additionally, the direct relationship between male gender and department competitiveness is not provided, which further muddles the connection between male gender and lactose intolerance. The more direct and strong relationship is between department competitiveness and lactose intolerance, which is not directly related to male gender. The probability of being lactose intolerant is higher when not observing male gender (51% vs 1%), which suggests that the chance of being lactose intolerant is larger when not observing male gender.||",
