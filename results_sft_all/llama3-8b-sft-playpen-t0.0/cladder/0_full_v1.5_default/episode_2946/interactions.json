Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. We know that male gender causes non-competitive department. male gender or competitive department causes admission acceptance. Would the applicant gets rejected if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since male gender or competitive department causes admission acceptance, and we already established that male gender is associated with a lower degree of competition, this suggests that male gender is not a direct cause of admission acceptance in this context. The direct effect of male gender on non-competitive department and the subsequent effect of competitive department on admission acceptance imply that male gender is not a direct cause of admission acceptance.
