Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of respiratory issues is 50%. For people with no respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 6%. For people with respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 6%. Is broken bones less likely than no broken bones overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of respiratory issues is 50%, this means that 50% of the population has respiratory issues and 6% of that 50% (or 3%) have both respiratory issues and broken bones. The remaining 47% of the population without respiratory issues still have a 6% chance of broken bones, which is 2.82% of the total population. In total, 3% (with both respiratory issues and broken bones) + 2.82% (with only broken bones) = 5.82% of the total population have broken bones. This is higher than the 3% of the total population that has no broken bones (since 50% of the total population has respiratory issues and 1% of that 50% has both respiratory issues and no broken bones).<|eot_id|>",
