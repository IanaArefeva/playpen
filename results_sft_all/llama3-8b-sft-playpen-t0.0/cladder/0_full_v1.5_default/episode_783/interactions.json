The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how gender correlates with salary in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to occupation. To understand how gender affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that looking at the relationship between occupation and salary (Method 2) could lead to spurious conclusions about the relationship between occupation and salary, which in turn could lead to spurious conclusions about the relationship between occupation and salary by gender (if we condition on occupation). In other words, the relationship between occupation and salary is not a direct reflection of the relationship between occupation and skill, which is what we care about when looking at the relationship between occupation and salary by gender. In this case, looking at the general relationship between occupation and salary (Method 1) is more likely to reveal the correct relationship between occupation and skill, which is what we care about when looking at the relationship between occupation and salary by gender.||",
