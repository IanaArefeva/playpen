Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of tanned skin is 21%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of tanned skin is 72%. For people who went to tanning salons, would it be less likely to see tanned skin if the person had not had a tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of tanned skin is higher for people who used tanning salon treatments (72%) than for those who did not (21%). This difference in probability is not dependent on whether the person also went to the beach. The beach visit does not conditionally reduce the probability of tanned skin for those who used tanning salon treatments.<|eot_id|>",
