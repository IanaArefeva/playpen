The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 57%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 1%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 97%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 92%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 54%. The overall probability of smoking is 45%. Will smoking increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer among smokers is lower than that among nonsmokers in both scenarios with and without a high tar deposit. This suggests that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is more complex than a direct cause-and-effect relationship. The higher probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers with a high tar deposit compared to those without a high tar deposit further blurs the direct link between smoking and lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
