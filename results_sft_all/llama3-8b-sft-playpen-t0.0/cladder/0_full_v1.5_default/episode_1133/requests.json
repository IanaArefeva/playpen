The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 3%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 33%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 60%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 93%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 49%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\n\nLet's consider the following counterfactuals:\n- If a patient has a small kidney stone and does not receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 3%.\n- If a patient has a small kidney stone and does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 33%.\n\nNext, we need to consider the counterfactuals for large kidney stones:\n- If a patient has a large kidney stone and does not receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 60%.\n- If a patient has a large kidney stone and does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 93%.\n\nGiven that the overall probability of large kidney stone is 49%, we can conclude that the probability of having a large kidney stone is higher than that of having a small kidney stone. This is a critical insight, as it directly affects the counterfactuals and our ability to reason about the relationships between the variables.\n\nNow, consider the following counterfactual: if a patient has a large kidney stone and does not receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 60%. This is higher than the probability of recovery for a patient with a small kidney stone and no treatment (3%).\n\nNext, consider the counterfactual: if a patient has a large kidney stone",
