Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 3%. The probability of non-male gender and admission acceptance is 40%. The probability of male gender and admission acceptance is 1%. Is the chance of admission acceptance larger when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that male gender is associated with higher department competitiveness, which in turn is associated with higher admission acceptance. The given probabilities of male and non-male gender and their corresponding admission acceptance rates are: male (3%) and male admission (1%), and non-male (97%) and non-male admission (40%). The difference in admission acceptance between male and non-male is 1% - 40% = -39%. This negative difference indicates that male gender is associated with lower admission acceptance than non-male gender, not higher.<|eot_id|>",
