The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 67%. For individuals who are not male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 45%. For individuals who are male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 42%. For individuals who are male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 25%. For individuals who are not male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 66%. For individuals who are not male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 44%. For individuals who are male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 39%. For individuals who are male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 9%. The overall probability of high skill level is 80%. If we disregard the mediation effect through occupation, would gender negatively affect salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
