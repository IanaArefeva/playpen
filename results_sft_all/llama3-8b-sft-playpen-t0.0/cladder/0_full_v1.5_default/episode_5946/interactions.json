The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England and director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to retain the employee. Would the employee is fired if not having visited England instead of having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the CEO's decision to fire the employee is the cause of both having visited England and the director's action, we need to consider whether the absence of having visited England would still lead to the same outcome (employee being fired) through the direct effect of the director's action. In this case, the director's action is still a direct cause of the employee being fired, independent of having visited England. Therefore, if not having visited England, the director would still sign the termination letter, and the employee would still be fired.||",
