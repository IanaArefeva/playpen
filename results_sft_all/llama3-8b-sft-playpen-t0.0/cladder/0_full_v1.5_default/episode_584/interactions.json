The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 65%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 84%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be less likely to see high salary if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this world, having a college degree directly affects skill, and skill in turn affects the likelihood of having a high salary. Since the person with a college degree already has a higher skill level, the absence of a college degree would not reduce the likelihood of a high salary; rather, it would reduce the likelihood of having a college degree in the first place, which is not the focus of this question.||",
