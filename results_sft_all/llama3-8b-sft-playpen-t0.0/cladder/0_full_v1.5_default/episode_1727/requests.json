The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 2%. The probability of waking up on time and arriving to school on time is 46%. The probability of waking up late and arriving to school on time is 1%. Is the chance of arriving to school on time larger when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of both waking up late and arriving to school on time is 1%. Since the probability of waking up late is so small, it's likely that most of the time when Alice is late, she's not just late but also doesn't show up at all. In that case, the probability of arriving to school on time when waking up late is still 1%. In the absence of any additional information or unmentioned factors, we can conclude that the chance of arriving to school on time is not larger when observing waking up late.<|eot_id|>",
