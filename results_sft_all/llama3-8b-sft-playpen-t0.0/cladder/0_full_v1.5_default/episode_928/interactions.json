The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 41%. For obese people, would it be more likely to see long lifespan if the person had been normal weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only direct relationships we have are: \n- Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan.\n- Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan.\n- Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan.\n- For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 70%.\n\nGiven that we have no direct relationship between being normal weight and having a long lifespan, we must consider the relationships through other variables. The only path we have is through the relationship between normal weight and the absence of diabetes, which in turn affects the probability of a long lifespan. If we consider the chain of relationships: normal weight - absence of diabetes - long lifespan, we can conclude that being normal weight would lead to a higher probability of having a long lifespan, as the absence of diabetes directly affects the probability of a long lifespan.||",
