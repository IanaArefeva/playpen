Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. We know that tanning salon treatment and going to the beach causes large feet. We observed the person goes to the beach.

Since we are asked to consider the counterfactual where the person does not get tanning salon treatment, we must focus on the beach visit. The beach visit is the direct cause of large feet in this person, and we have no reason to believe that the absence of tanning salon treatment would change the foot size outcome. In other words, the beach visit is the primary cause of large feet, and the tanning salon treatment is a separate, additional cause. If we remove the tanning salon treatment, the person still goes to the beach, which remains the primary cause of large feet.<|eot_id|>",
