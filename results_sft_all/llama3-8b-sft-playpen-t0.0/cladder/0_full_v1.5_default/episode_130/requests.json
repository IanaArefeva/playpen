The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 66%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 19%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 61%. Is employee being fired less likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the manager not signing the letter and the employee being fired is 0.34 * 0.19 = 0.065. The probability of the manager not signing the letter and the employee not being fired is 0.34 * 0.81 = 0.275. The probability of the manager signing the letter and the employee being fired is 0.66 * 0.61 = 0.402. The probability of the manager signing the letter and the employee not being fired is 0.66 * 0.39 = 0.257. The total probability of the employee being fired is 0.065 + 0.402 = 0.467. The total probability of the employee not being fired is 0.275 + 0.257 = 0.532. Since 0.532 > 0.467, the probability of the employee not being fired is higher than the probability of the employee being fired.<|eot_id|>",
