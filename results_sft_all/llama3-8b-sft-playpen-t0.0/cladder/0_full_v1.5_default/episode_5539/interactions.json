The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on full moon and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on full moon. Full moon has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how full moon correlates with price case by case according to demand. Method 2: We look directly at how full moon correlates with price in general. To understand how full moon affects price, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In Method 1, we condition on demand, but demand is unobserved, so we can't condition on it. In Method 2, we look at the general relationship between full moon and price, but we're not accounting for the unobserved demand. A more correct approach would involve looking at the joint relationship between demand and full moon, and then seeing how that joint relationship affects price.||",
