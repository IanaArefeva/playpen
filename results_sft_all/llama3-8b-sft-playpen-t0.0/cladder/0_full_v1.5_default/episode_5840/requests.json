The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of having a sister is 99%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 27%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 57%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the large majority of the population (99%) has a higher risk of lung cancer (57%). The remaining 1% of the population, who do not have a sister, still has a risk of lung cancer (27%). Since the large majority of the population has a higher risk of lung cancer, the overall probability of lung cancer is higher than the probability of absence of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
