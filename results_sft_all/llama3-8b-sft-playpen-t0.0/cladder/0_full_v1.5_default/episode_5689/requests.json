The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 81%. For infants who do not have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 83%. For infants who have a sister, the probability of high infant mortality is 65%. Is high infant mortality more likely than low infant mortality overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that 65% of the total population (81% of the total) has high infant mortality. The remaining 35% of the total population does not have a sister, and among them, the probability of high infant mortality is 83%. This means that 0.35 * 0.83 = 0.2925 of the total population has high infant mortality without a sister. In total, 0.65 + 0.2925 = 0.9425 of the total population has high infant mortality. Since 1 - 0.9425 = 0.0575 of the total population has low infant mortality, we conclude that high infant mortality is more likely than low infant mortality overall.<|eot_id|>",
