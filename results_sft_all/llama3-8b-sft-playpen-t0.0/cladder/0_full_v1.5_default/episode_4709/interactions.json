The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For people who have not visited England, the probability of the prisoner's death is 40%. For people who have visited England, the probability of the prisoner's death is 78%. Does having visited England positively affect prisoner through the corporal and the private?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
