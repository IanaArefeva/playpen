Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender or in-state residency or competitive department causes brown eyes. We observed the residency is out-of-state.

Since we already know that the applicant is male and that male gender or in-state residency or competitive department cause brown eyes, we need to consider the effect of male gender on brown eyes through the intermediate variable of competitive department. If the applicant is male, then male gender would lead to a competitive department, which in turn would lead to brown eyes. Since we already know that the applicant is male, we can conclude that the applicant would have brown eyes if male gender instead of non-male gender.<|eot_id|>",
