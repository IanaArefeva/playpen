Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For situations where there is no solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 39%. For situations where there is a solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 4%. Will solar eclipse increase the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the solar eclipse directly counteracts the positive effect of not having a solar eclipse, which is a 39% chance of arriving on time. In the absence of a solar eclipse, the probability of Alice arriving on time is 39%, which is higher than the 4% chance when a solar eclipse occurs. This indicates that the solar eclipse has a negative effect on Alice's arrival time, rather than increasing the chance of arriving on time.<|eot_id|>",
