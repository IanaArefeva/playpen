The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes not having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to retain the employee. Would the employee is not fired if not having visited England instead of having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that the CEO's decision to fire the employee is the cause of not having visited England, we can conclude that not having visited England is not a sufficient condition for the employee not being fired. In other words, the absence of having visited England does not imply the absence of the CEO's decision to fire the employee, which is the direct cause of the employee's fate.||",
