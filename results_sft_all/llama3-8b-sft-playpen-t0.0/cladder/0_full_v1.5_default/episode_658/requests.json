The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 27%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 52%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 47%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 82%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 31%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 57%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would encouragement level negatively affect exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This positive relationship between encouragement and exam score directly counters the idea that encouragement would negatively affect exam score.<|eot_id|>",
