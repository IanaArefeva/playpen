The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 83%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 56%. For patients consuming citrus, would it be more likely to see curly hair if the patient had not consumed citrus?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having curly hair is not directly related to whether the person consumed citrus in the past; it is only related to whether they consume citrus now. If a person consumed citrus in the past but is not now, their probability of having curly hair remains the same as those who have never consumed citrus, which is 83%.||",
