The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 43%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 81%. Will liking spicy food decrease the chance of the forest on fire?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of the smoker on the forest is also positive, further increasing the probability of the forest on fire. The probability of the forest on fire for people who like spicy food is higher than for those who do not like spicy food, which suggests that the positive direct effect of liking spicy food on the forest is not counteracted by any negative indirect effects.||",
