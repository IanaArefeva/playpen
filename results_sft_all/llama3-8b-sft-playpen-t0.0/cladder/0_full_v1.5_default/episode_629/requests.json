Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 55%. For students who are not talented, the probability of being hard-working is 45%. For students who are talented, the probability of being hard-working is 45%. Is being hard-working more likely than being lazy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since 55% of the students are talented and 45% of the remaining 45% (or 20.25% of the total) are hard-working, we can conclude that the overall probability of being hard-working is less than the probability of being lazy (45% of 55% is 20.25%, and 45% of 45% is 20.25%).<|eot_id|>",
