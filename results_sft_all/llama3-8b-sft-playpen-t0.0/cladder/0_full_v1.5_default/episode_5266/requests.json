Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of freckles is 59%. For individuals who are male, the probability of freckles is 55%. Will male gender decrease the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that male gender has a net positive effect on the probability of freckles, rather than a negative one.<|eot_id|>",
