The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 26%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 67%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 38%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 63%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 65%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 11%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender negatively affect admission status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In fact, being male has a positive direct effect on admission status, as the probability of admission acceptance is higher for males than for females in both competitive and non-competitive departments. The direct effect of being male on admission status is 38% in a non-competitive department and 63% in a competitive department, which are both higher than the corresponding probabilities for females (26% and 67%, respectively).<|eot_id|>",
