Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of speaking english is 94%. For people who do not speak english, the probability of talent is 83%. For people who speak english, the probability of talent is 83%.

Since the probability of not speaking English is 6% and the probability of having talent is 83% for those who do not speak English, the overall probability of having talent is 0.5 * 0.06 + 0.5 * 0.83 = 0.415. The probability of lacking talent is 1 - 0.415 = 0.585. Since 0.585 is greater than 0.415, it is more likely that a person lacks talent than that they have it.<|eot_id|>",
