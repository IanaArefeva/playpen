This does not imply that encouragement will reduce the chance of a high exam score; rather, it means that encouragement will lead to a lower exam score than not being encouraged. The studying habits of students who are encouraged and those who are not will still be different, and the exam score will be lower for those who are encouraged.<|eot_id|>",
