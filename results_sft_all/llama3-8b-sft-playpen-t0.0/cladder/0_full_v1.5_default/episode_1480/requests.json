The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 17%. For people not blowing out candles, the probability of dark room is 83%. For people who blow out candles, the probability of dark room is 46%. Is dark room more likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of blowing out the candle is 17%, we can weight the two probabilities by this fraction: (0.83 * 0.83) + (0.46 * 0.17) = 0.69 + 0.0782 = 0.7682. The probability of bright room is then 1 - 0.7682 = 0.2318. Since 0.7682 > 0.2318, dark room is more likely than bright room overall.<|eot_id|>",
