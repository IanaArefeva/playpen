The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 66%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 30%. Does eating citrus positively affect scurvy through vitmain C?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of scurvy is lower for citrus consumers (30%) than for non-consumers (66%). This reduction in scurvy risk is a direct result of the citrus consumption, which in turn directly affects the levels of vitmain C. The positive relationship between citrus consumption and scurvy risk is not through a direct link but rather through the reduction of scurvy risk achieved by citrus consumption, which is a result of the citrus's positive effect on vitmain C.||",
