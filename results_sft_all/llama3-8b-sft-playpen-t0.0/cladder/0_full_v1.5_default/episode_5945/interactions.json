The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. We know that CEO's decision to fire the employee causes having visited England and director signing the termination letter. having visited England or director signing the termination letter causes employee being fired. We observed the CEO decides to fire the employee. Would the employee is not fired if having visited England instead of not having visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The primary cause of the employee's firing is the CEO's decision to fire the employee, which directly affects both the director and the employee. The director's action of signing the termination letter is also a direct result of the CEO's decision. The having visited England condition is an intervening cause that affects the director and the employee, but it is not the primary cause of the employee's firing. If having visited England instead of not having visited England, the director might still sign the termination letter, and the CEO's decision to fire the employee would still be the primary cause of the employee's firing.||",
