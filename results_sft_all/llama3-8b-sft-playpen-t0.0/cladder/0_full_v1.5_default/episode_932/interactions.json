The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 6%. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 79%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 72%. Is long lifespan more likely than short lifespan overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan is not directly quantified, but since we are not given any direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan, we can conclude that the probability of long lifespan is not higher than short lifespan for people who smoke. The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is that the probability of long lifespan is lower for people with diabetes than for those without it. Since the probability of long lifespan is lower for both obese and normal weight people with diabetes than for those without it, we can conclude that the probability of long lifespan is not higher than short lifespan for people with diabetes. Finally, the direct relationship between obesity and diabetes is that the probability of diabetes is higher for obese people than for normal weight people. Since the probability of long lifespan is lower for both obese and normal weight people with diabetes than for those without it, we can conclude that the probability of long lifespan is not higher than short lifespan for people with diabetes.||",
