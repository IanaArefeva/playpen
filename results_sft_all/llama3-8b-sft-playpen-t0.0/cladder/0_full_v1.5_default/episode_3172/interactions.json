The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 10%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of ringing alarm is 69%. For people who drink coffee, would it be less likely to see ringing alarm if the person did not drink coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is determined by the direct effect of the coffee and the direct effect of the wife, not by the person's behavior (drinking coffee or not). Since the direct effect of the coffee on the alarm clock is positive (69% chance of the alarm clock ringing), and the direct effect of the wife on the alarm clock is also positive, the probability of the alarm clock ringing is higher when the person drinks coffee than when they do not.||",
