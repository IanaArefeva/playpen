The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of having a brother is 71%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 56%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 49%. Is smallpox survival more likely than smallpox death overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of having a brother is 71%, we can weight the survival probabilities by this fraction: (0.71 * 0.49) + (0.29 * 0.56) = 0.3479 + 0.1624 = 0.5103. The probability of smallpox death is 1 - 0.5103 = 0.4897. Since 0.5103 is less than 0.5, smallpox death is more likely than smallpox survival overall.<|eot_id|>",
