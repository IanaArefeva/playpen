Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 96%. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 26%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 49%.

In both scenarios, the probability of a heart condition is 1 - 0.26 = 0.74. The medication does not reduce the probability of a heart condition; it only shifts the probability of a heart condition from 0.74 to 0.51 in those who take medication. The overall probability of a heart condition is 0.74, which is higher than the probability of a heart condition in those who take medication (0.51) and those who do not take medication (0.74).<|eot_id|>",
