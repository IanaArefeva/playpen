The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 18%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 42%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 44%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 70%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 29%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 90%. Does encouragement level negatively affect exam score through studying habit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The exam score is higher for those who are encouraged and study hard (70%) than for those who are not encouraged and study hard (42%). This indicates that encouragement has a direct positive effect on exam score, rather than a negative effect through studying habits.<|eot_id|>",
