Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 21%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 64%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 29%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 67%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 31%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 70%. The overall probability of smoking is 55%. Will smoking decrease the chance of being allergic to peanuts?",
