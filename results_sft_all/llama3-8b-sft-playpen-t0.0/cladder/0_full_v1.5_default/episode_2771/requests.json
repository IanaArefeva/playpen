The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 52%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 44%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of clean water is 54%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of clean water is 26%. Will clean water increase the chance of cholera contraction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since water quality is not directly observable, we must consider the relationships between the observable variables. The probability of clean water is higher for people served by a local water company (54%) than for those served by a global water company (26%). This difference in clean water probability is associated with a lower probability of cholera contraction for the local water company (44%) compared to the global water company (52%). This pattern suggests that clean water is associated with a lower risk of cholera contraction, not a higher one.<|eot_id|>",
