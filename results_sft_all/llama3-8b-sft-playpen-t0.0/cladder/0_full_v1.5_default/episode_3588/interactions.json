The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. The overall probability of having a brother is 88%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 44%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 43%. Is smallpox survival more likely than smallpox death overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 88% of the population has a brother, and among them, 43% will survive smallpox. The remaining 12% of the population does not have a brother, and among them, the probability of smallpox survival is 44%. To find the overall probability of smallpox survival, we need to weight the probabilities by the fraction of the population that has a brother and those that do not. The fraction of the population that has a brother is 0.88, and the fraction that does not have a brother is 0.12. The overall probability of smallpox survival is then (0.88 * 0.43) + (0.12 * 0.44) = 0.3772 + 0.0528 = 0.4300. The probability of smallpox death is 1 - 0.4300 = 0.5699. Since 0.4300 is less than 0.5699, smallpox death is more likely than smallpox survival overall.||",
