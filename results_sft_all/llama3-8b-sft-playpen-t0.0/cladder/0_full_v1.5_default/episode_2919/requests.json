Skill has a direct effect on salary. We know that college degree or higher causes high skill level, and we know that high skill level causes low salary.

If we consider the opposite condition - having a high school degree or lower - we can conclude that this condition is associated with a lower skill level. Since there is no direct relationship between high school degree or lower and salary, we must consider the relationships through the intermediate variable, skill. A lower skill level is associated with a higher salary, so having a high school degree or lower would lead to a higher salary.<|eot_id|>",
