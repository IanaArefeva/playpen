The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 21%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 55%. For people who have a sister, would it be less likely to see healthy heart if the person did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The positive effect of having a sister on heart condition is distinct from the positive effect of blood pressure on heart condition. In this world, having a sister directly affects heart condition, and blood pressure also directly affects heart condition. The separate direct relationships between having a sister and heart condition, and between blood pressure and heart condition, imply that the positive effect of having a sister on heart condition is not dependent on blood pressure. This means that for people who have a sister, the probability of a healthy heart is higher than for those who do not have a sister, and this higher probability is not directly related to blood pressure.||",
