The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how education level correlates with foot size in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to unobserved confounders. To understand how education level affects foot size, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that any direct relationship we see between education level and foot size could be spurious, and we need to account for the unobserved confounder to get an accurate picture of the relationship. Method 1 looks at the general correlation between education level and foot size without accounting for the unobserved confounder, which could lead to a spurious relationship. Method 2, on the other hand, looks at the relationship case by case, which would account for the unobserved confounder and provide a more accurate picture of the relationship between education level and foot size.<|eot_id|>",
