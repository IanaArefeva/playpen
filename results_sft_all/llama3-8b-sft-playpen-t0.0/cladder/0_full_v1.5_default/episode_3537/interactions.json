The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and foot size. Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 33%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of large feet is 36%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of large feet is 41%. Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of large feet is higher for those who take the elevator (41%) than for those who take the stairs (36%), which might lead one to conclude that large feet are more likely than small feet. However, we must consider the overall probability of taking the elevator, which is 33%. This means that 67% of the time, people take the stairs, and in those cases, the probability of large feet is 36%. Since the probability of large feet is higher for those who take the stairs than for those who take the elevator, and the majority of people take the stairs, we can conclude that large feet are more likely than small feet overall.||",
