The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 60%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 10%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 80%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 33%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 89%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of large feet?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
