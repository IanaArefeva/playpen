The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 31%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 30%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 58%. Is normal infant birth weight less likely than low infant birth weight overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that, overall, normal birth weight is more likely than low birth weight, since the higher probability of normal birth weight among smoking mothers likely outweighs the lower probability of normal birth weight among nonsmoking mothers.<|eot_id|>",
