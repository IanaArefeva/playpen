The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 43%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 10%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 10%. Is talent less likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since 57% of the population is unattractive and 43% is attractive, the overall probability of having talent is a weighted average of the two groups, which is (0.57 * 0.10) + (0.43 * 0.10) = 0.095. The probability of lacking talent is 1 - 0.095 = 0.905. Since 0.095 is less than 0.905, it is more likely than lacking talent overall.||",
