The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how maternal smoking status correlates with infant mortality in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to infant's birth weight. To understand how maternal smoking status affects infant mortality, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the absence of any additional information about the health condition, we must consider the joint effect of both health condition and birth weight on infant mortality. Method 1 treats the relationship between maternal smoking and infant mortality as direct and isolated, which is not the case. Method 2 conditionally controls for birth weight but still treats the relationship between birth weight and infant mortality as direct, which is also not the case. A more appropriate approach would involve accounting for the joint effect of health condition and birth weight on infant mortality, which is not directly accessible in this setting.<|eot_id|>",
