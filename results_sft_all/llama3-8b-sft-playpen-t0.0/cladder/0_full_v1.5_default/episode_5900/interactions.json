The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a brother and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on having a brother. Having a brother has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 7%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 22%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of having a brother is 6%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of having a brother is 49%. Will having a brother decrease the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between having a brother and normal infant birth weight is positive, as having a brother is associated with a higher probability of normal birth weight in areas with high cigarette tax (49% having a brother, 22% normal birth weight). The unobserved confounder exerts a negative effect on both having a brother and normal birth weight, which is why we see a lower probability of normal birth weight in areas with a lower cigarette tax (7% normal birth weight, 6% having a brother).||",
