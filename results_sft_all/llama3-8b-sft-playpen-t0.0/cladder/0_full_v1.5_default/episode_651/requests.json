Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 13%. For students who are not talented, the probability of being hard-working is 4%. For students who are talented, the probability of being hard-working is 4%. Is being hard-working less likely than being lazy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being talented is 13%, and the probability of being hard-working is 4% for both groups, we can conclude that the overall probability of being hard-working is 4% (0.13 x 4% + 0.87 x 4% = 4%). In this world, being hard-working is not less likely than being lazy overall.<|eot_id|>",
