The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 65%. The probability of not blowing out the candle and dark room is 10%. The probability of blowing out the candle and dark room is 41%. Is the chance of dark room smaller when observing blowing out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a dark room is 41% when the candle is blown out and 10% when the candle is not blown out. The difference in probability is entirely due to the different scenarios (candle blown out or not), not the state of the room (dark or light).<|eot_id|>",
