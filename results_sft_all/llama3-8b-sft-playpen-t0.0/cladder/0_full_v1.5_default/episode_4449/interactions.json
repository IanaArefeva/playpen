The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not listen to jazz and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 53%. For people who do not listen to jazz and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 80%. For people who listen to jazz and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For people who listen to jazz and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 82%. For people who do not listen to jazz and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 49%. For people who do not listen to jazz and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 43%. For people who listen to jazz and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 92%. For people who listen to jazz and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 99%. The overall probability of high pollution is 53%. Does listening to jazz positively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
