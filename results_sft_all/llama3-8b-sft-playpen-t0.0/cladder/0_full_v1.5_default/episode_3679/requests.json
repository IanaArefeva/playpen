The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 2%. For people without a college degree, the probability of black hair is 13%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of black hair is 58%. Is black hair more likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of college degree or higher is only 2%, the overall probability of black hair is mostly determined by the 13% probability for those without a college degree. In contrast, the probability of blond hair is not directly provided, but we can conclude that it is more likely than black hair overall since the 2% probability of college degree or higher is a small fraction of the total population, and the remaining 98% of the population likely has a lower probability of black hair than the 13% for those without a college degree.<|eot_id|>",
