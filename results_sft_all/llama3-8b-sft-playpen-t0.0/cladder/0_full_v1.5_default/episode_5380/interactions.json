The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 95%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 70%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 59%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 33%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 91%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 88%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 59%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 46%. The overall probability of confounder active is 55%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect lactose intolerance through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key insight here is that the effect of parents' intelligence on children's lactose intolerance is different depending on whether the parents have a high or a low social status. This suggests that the relationship between parents' intelligence and children's lactose intolerance is not direct but rather is subject to the intervening variable of parents' social status.\nTo further support this conclusion, we can examine the specific probabilities associated with different combinations of parents' intelligence and social status. For children with intelligent parents and a high social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 33%, which is lower than the corresponding probability for children with unintelligent parents and a high social status (70%). This suggests that parents' intelligence has a negative effect on children's lactose intolerance when parents have a high social status.\nIn contrast, for children with intelligent parents and a low social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 59%, which is higher than the corresponding probability for children with unintelligent parents and a low social status (95%). This suggests that parents' intelligence has a positive effect on children's lactose intolerance when parents have a low social status.\nHowever, we must also consider the role of the unobserved confounder. The probability of high parental social status is higher for children with active confounder than for children with inactive confounder, which suggests that",
