The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 14%. The probability of nonsmoking mother and normal infant birth weight is 14%. The probability of smoking mother and normal infant birth weight is 6%. Is the chance of normal infant birth weight smaller when observing smoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of normal birth weight is higher in the smoking mother group (6%) than in the non-smoking mother group (14%). This positive relationship between maternal smoking and birth weight suggests that the chance of normal birth weight is not smaller when observing a smoking mother, but rather larger.<|eot_id|>",
