Since the person is close to a college and their confounder is active, they will drink coffee. The direct effect of coffee on their salary is positive, meaning that if they drink coffee, their salary will be higher than if they don't. Since the person's unobserved confounder is active, their salary will be higher than if the confounder was inactive. In this case, the person's unobserved confounder is active, so their salary will be higher than if the confounder was inactive, and the direct effect of coffee on their salary is positive, so their salary will be higher than if they didn't drink coffee.<|eot_id|>",
