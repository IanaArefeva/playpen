The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 92%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 77%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 12%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 1%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 54%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When we condition on the event that a patient is receiving treatment, we are focusing on the 46% of patients who have small kidney stones. In this subpopulation, the probability of recovery is 77% for those who have small kidney stones and are receiving treatment, and 92% for those who have small kidney stones and are not receiving treatment. Since 92% is higher than 77%, it is more likely to see recovery if the patient had not received treatment, given that they are already in the subpopulation of patients with small kidney stones and are now being considered for the event of being treated.<|eot_id|>",
