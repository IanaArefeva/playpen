The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 1%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 74%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 21%. Is ringing alarm less likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a ring alarm when the husband sets the alarm is 1% (P(set alarm) = 1%) and the probability of a ring alarm when the husband doesn't set the alarm is 74% (P(set alarm) = 0, P(ring alarm) = 74%). The probability of a ring alarm is then 1% + 0.74 = 1.74%. The probability of a silent alarm is the probability of a ring alarm when the husband sets the alarm, which is 1%. Since 1.74% is greater than 1%, the ring alarm is more likely than the silent alarm.||",
