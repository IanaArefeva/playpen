The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who do not like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 44%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 19%. For individuals who like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 44%. For individuals who like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 19%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 71%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 32%. For individuals who like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 65%. For individuals who like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 37%. The overall probability of high skill level is 86%. Does liking spicy food negatively affect salary through occupation?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the direct effect of liking spicy food on occupation does not translate into a negative effect on salary. In other words, the positive relationship between occupation and salary is not disrupted by the presence of spice preference.||",
