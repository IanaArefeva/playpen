Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 22%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 31%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 39%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 75%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?",
