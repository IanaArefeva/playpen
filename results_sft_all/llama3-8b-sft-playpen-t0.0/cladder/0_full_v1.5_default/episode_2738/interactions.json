The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 22%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 31%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 39%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 75%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

          "content": "No\nThe relationship between maternal smoking and infant birth weight is direct, meaning that if a mother smokes, it directly affects the birth weight of her child. The probability of normal birth weight is higher in areas with high cigarette tax, which also have higher probabilities of maternal smoking. This suggests that the positive effect of higher cigarette tax on birth weight is likely due to its effect on maternal smoking behavior, rather than any direct positive effect of the cigarette tax on birth weight. Since the direct relationship between maternal smoking and birth weight is negative, and the positive effect of the cigarette tax on birth weight is likely due to its effect on maternal smoking, we conclude that smoking a mother will decrease the chance of normal infant birth weight.||",
