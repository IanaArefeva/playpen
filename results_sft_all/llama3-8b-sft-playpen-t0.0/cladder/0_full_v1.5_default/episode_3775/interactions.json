The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Method 1: We look at how listening to jazz correlates with effort case by case according to elite institution admission status. Method 2: We look directly at how listening to jazz correlates with effort in general. To understand how listening to jazz affects effort, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this specific setting, the direct relationship between \"listening to jazz\" and \"effort\" is not the primary focus; rather, we want to examine how \"listening to jazz\" affects \"effort\" in the context of \"elite institution admission status\". Since the direct relationship between \"listening to jazz\" and \"effort\" is not the main target of our investigation, we should not use Method 2, which looks at the general relationship between \"listening to jazz\" and \"effort\" without considering the specific context of \"elite institution admission status\". In this case, looking at the relationship between \"listening to jazz\" and \"effort\" on a case-by-case basis according to \"elite institution admission status\" (Method 1) is more appropriate, as it directly addresses the question of how \"listening to jazz\" affects \"effort\" in the specific context of \"elite institution admission status\".||",
