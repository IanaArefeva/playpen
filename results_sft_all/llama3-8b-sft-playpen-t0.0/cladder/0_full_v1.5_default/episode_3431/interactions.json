The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 3%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 26%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of the forest on fire is 69%. Is the forest on fire less likely than the forest not on fire overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The overall probability of the forest on fire is the weighted average of these two probabilities, where the weights are the probabilities of each group. The probability of not liking spicy food is 97% (100% - 3%), and the probability of liking spicy food is 3%. The overall probability of the forest on fire is (0.26 * 0.97) + (0.69 * 0.03) = 0.2523 + 0.0207 = 0.273. The probability of the forest not on fire is 1 - 0.273 = 0.727. Since 0.727 is less than 0.273, the forest is less likely to be on fire than not on fire overall.||",
