The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 22%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 50%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 22%. Is normal infant birth weight less likely than low infant birth weight overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of a mother being a smoker is 22%, the overall probability of normal birth weight is a weighted average of the two probabilities, which is (0.22 * 0.22) + (0.78 * 0.5) = 0.26. The probability of normal birth weight is less than the probability of normal birth weight for infants with nonsmoking mothers, which is 0.5. The probability of normal birth weight is also less than the probability of normal birth weight for infants with smoking mothers, which is 0.22. The probability of normal birth weight is less than the probability of normal birth weight for both subgroups, which are 0.5 and 0.22, respectively.<|eot_id|>",
