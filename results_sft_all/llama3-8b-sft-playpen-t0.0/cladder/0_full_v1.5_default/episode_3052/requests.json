Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives treatment. large kidney stone or receives treatment causes recovery. We observed the patient has a large kidney stone.

Since we already know that the patient has a large kidney stone, we can conclude that they will indeed receive treatment. Once they receive treatment, the direct relationship between treatment and recovery means that they will also recover. The condition of having a large kidney stone is already accounted for in the chain of cause and effect, so the specific action of \"receiving no treatment\" is not necessary to conclude that the patient will still recover.<|eot_id|>",
