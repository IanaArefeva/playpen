The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives treatment. large kidney stone or receives treatment causes recovery. We observed the patient has a large kidney stone. Would the patient doesn't recover if receives no treatment instead of receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that the patient has a large kidney stone, we can conclude that they will indeed receive treatment. Once they receive treatment, the direct relationship between treatment and recovery means that they will also recover. The condition of having a large kidney stone is already accounted for in the chain of cause and effect, so the specific action of \"receiving no treatment\" is not necessary to conclude that the patient will still recover.||",
