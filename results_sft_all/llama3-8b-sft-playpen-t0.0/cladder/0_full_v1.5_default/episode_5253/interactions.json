The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and freckles. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on freckles. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 41%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 64%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of freckles is 64%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of freckles is 87%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 8%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 39%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 44%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 72%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 1%. Does gender positively affect freckles through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of being male on the probability of freckles is not dependent on the department's competitiveness. The probability of freckles for male and male participants in both competitive and non-competitive departments is higher than for female participants in both competitive and non-competitive departments, which suggests that the direct effect of being male on the probability of freckles is not being mediated by the department's competitiveness.||",
