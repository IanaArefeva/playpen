Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 1%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 79%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 30%. Is ringing alarm less likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a ring alarm when the husband sets the alarm is lower than the probability of a ring alarm when the husband doesn't set the alarm. The overall probability of a ring alarm is the sum of the probability of a ring alarm when the husband sets the alarm and the probability of a ring alarm when the husband doesn't set the alarm, which is 1% + 0.79 = 1.79%. The probability of a ring alarm is higher than the probability of a ring alarm when the husband sets the alarm, which is 1%. The probability of a ring alarm is also higher than the probability of a ring alarm when the husband doesn't set the alarm, which is 0.79%. The probability of a ring alarm is higher than the probability of a ring alarm when the husband sets the alarm, which is 1%. The probability of a ring alarm is also higher than the probability of a ring alarm when the husband doesn't set the alarm, which is 0.79%.<|eot_id|>",
