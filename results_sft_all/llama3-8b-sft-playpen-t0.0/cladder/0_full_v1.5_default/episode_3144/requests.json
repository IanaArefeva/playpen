Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 76%. The probability of not drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 12%. The probability of drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 48%. Is the chance of ringing alarm larger when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of not drinking coffee is higher than the probability of not drinking coffee and ringing alarm, the chance of ringing alarm is larger when not observing drinking coffee.<|eot_id|>",
