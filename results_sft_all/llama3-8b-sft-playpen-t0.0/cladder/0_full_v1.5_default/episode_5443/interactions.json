The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 32%. For people who do not play card games and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 60%. For people who play card games and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 62%. For people who play card games and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 81%. For people who do not play card games and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 57%. For people who do not play card games and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 68%. For people who play card games and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 31%. For people who play card games and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 19%. The overall probability of smoker is 88%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would playing card games positively affect lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
