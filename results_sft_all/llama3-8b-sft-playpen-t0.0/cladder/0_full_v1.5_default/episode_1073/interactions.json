The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 52%. The probability of receives no treatment and recovery is 30%. The probability of receives treatment and recovery is 15%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of recovery is higher when no treatment is given (30%) than when treatment is given (15%). This counterintuitive result is due to the interaction between the direct effects of treatment and the base rate of the control condition (no treatment). The control condition has a higher probability of recovery than the treatment condition, which means that the control condition exerts a positive influence on the probability of recovery.||",
