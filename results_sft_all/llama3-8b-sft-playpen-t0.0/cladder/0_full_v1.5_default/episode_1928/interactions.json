The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 91%. For people considered unattractive and are not famous, the probability of talent is 97%. For people considered unattractive and are famous, the probability of talent is 91%. For people considered attractive and are not famous, the probability of talent is 97%. For people considered attractive and are famous, the probability of talent is 82%. If we look at people who are famous, does the chance of talent increase when attractive appearance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In this subpopulation, the probability of talent is already high (82% for those who are both famous and attractive, and 91% for those who are famous but unattractive). The additional information about the probability of talent in the subpopulation of famous people does not change the fact that the subpopulation of famous people already has a high probability of talent. The increase in probability of talent when moving from unattractive to attractive within the subpopulation of famous people is not a cause of the higher probability of talent in the subpopulation of famous people, but rather a reflection of the already high probability of talent in that subpopulation.||",
