The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 55%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 80%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 40%. Is cholera contraction less likely than cholera prevention overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the overall probability of liking spicy food is 55%, we can weight the probabilities of cholera contraction by this fraction: (0.4 * 0.55) + (0.8 * 0.45) = 0.22 + 0.36 = 0.58. The probability of cholera prevention is 1 - 0.58 = 0.42. Since 0.58 is greater than 0.42, cholera contraction is more likely than cholera prevention overall.<|eot_id|>",
