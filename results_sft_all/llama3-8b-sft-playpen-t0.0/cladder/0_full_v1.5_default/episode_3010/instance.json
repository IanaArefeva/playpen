Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. We know that increased demand or increased yield per acre causes increased supply. increased demand and increased supply causes increased price. We observed the farm has a reduced yield per acre and the demand is low. Would there is an increased price if increased supply instead of reduced supply?",
