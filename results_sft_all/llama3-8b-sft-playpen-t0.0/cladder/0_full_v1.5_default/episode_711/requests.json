Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 40%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 66%. For individuals who are male, would it be less likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that being male directly leads to a higher probability of admission acceptance. The department competitiveness and its direct effect on admission status do not change the fact that being male still directly leads to a higher probability of admission acceptance.<|eot_id|>",
