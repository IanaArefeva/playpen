The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of having a sister is 59%. The probability of not having a sister and healthy heart is 16%. The probability of having a sister and healthy heart is 47%. Is the chance of healthy heart smaller when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having a sister and a healthy heart is higher than the probability of not having a sister and a healthy heart, which suggests that having a sister is associated with a lower risk of heart condition. The direct link between having a sister and heart condition supersedes the blood pressure link, which means that the positive effect of having a sister on heart condition is not offset by the negative effect of higher blood pressure.||",
