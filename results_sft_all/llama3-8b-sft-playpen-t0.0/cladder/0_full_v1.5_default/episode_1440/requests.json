The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 4%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 90%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 31%. Is ringing alarm less likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a ring alarm when the husband sets the alarm is 4% (the probability of the husband setting the alarm) times 31% (the probability of a ring alarm when the husband sets the alarm), which is 1.24%. The probability of a ring alarm when the husband doesn't set the alarm is 96% (the probability of the husband not setting the alarm) times 90% (the probability of a ring alarm when the husband doesn't set the alarm), which is 86.4%. The total probability of a ring alarm is the sum of these two, which is 87.64%. The probability of a silent alarm is the probability of the husband not setting the alarm (96%) times the probability of a ring alarm when the husband doesn't set the alarm (90%), which is 86.4%. Since 87.64% is greater than 86.4%, the probability of a ring alarm is higher than the probability of a silent alarm.<|eot_id|>",
