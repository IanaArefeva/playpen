The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 16%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 52%. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 37%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 71%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 13%.

Since the overall probability of the CEO's decision to fire the employee is 13%, we can conclude that having visited England does not increase the chance of the employee being fired.<|eot_id|>",
