The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 54%. The probability of not liking spicy food and dark room is 16%. The probability of liking spicy food and dark room is 36%. Is the chance of dark room smaller when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of dark room is determined by the joint probability of not liking spicy food and dark room, which is 16%. The joint probability of liking spicy food and dark room is 36%, which is higher than the probability of not liking spicy food and dark room.
