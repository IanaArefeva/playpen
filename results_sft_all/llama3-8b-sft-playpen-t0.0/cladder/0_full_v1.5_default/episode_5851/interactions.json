The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 32%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 14%. Does having a sister positively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The correct relationship is that having a sister directly affects the probability of lung cancer, with a lower probability of lung cancer for those who have a sister (14%) compared to those who do not have a sister (32%). Tar deposit is an intermediate variable that affects lung cancer, but it is not the direct cause of the difference in lung cancer probability between those with and without a sister.||",
