The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who do not like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 70%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 48%. For individuals who like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 44%. For individuals who like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 17%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 74%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 45%. For individuals who like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 49%. For individuals who like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 18%. The overall probability of high skill level is 95%. If we disregard the mediation effect through occupation, would liking spicy food negatively affect salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
