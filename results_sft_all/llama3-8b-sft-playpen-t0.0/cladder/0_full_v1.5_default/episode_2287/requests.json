Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 93%. The probability of nonsmoking and college admission is 3%. The probability of smoking and college admission is 62%.

This suggests that college admission is more likely when we condition on smoking rather than on nonsmoking.<|eot_id|>",
