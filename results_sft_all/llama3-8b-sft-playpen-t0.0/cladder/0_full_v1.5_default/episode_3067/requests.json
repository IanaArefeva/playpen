Since they have no pre-conditions, they are more likely to get the vaccine rather than refuse it. Once they get the vaccine, it directly affects their disease state, leading to a positive outcome (recovery from the disease). In this scenario, the person is likely to get the vaccine and then recover from the disease, rather than dying from it.<|eot_id|>",
