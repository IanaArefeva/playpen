Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 36%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 55%. Will alarm set by husband decrease the chance of ringing alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm ringing is higher when the husband sets the alarm (55%) than when he doesn't (36%). The direct relationship between the husband and the alarm clock does not imply that setting the alarm by the husband would reduce the chance of the alarm ringing. In fact, setting the alarm by the husband directly increases the probability of the alarm ringing.<|eot_id|>",
