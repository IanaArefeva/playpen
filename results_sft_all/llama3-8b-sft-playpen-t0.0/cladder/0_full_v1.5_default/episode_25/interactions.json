The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 0%. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 48%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 36%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 80%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 79%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 54%. Does husband negatively affect alarm clock through wife?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is higher when both the husband and the wife set the alarm (80%) than when only the husband sets the alarm (36%) or only the wife sets the alarm (48%). This suggests that the husband's behavior has a positive effect on the alarm clock, independent of the wife's behavior.||",
