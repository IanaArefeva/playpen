The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 17%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 19%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 60%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 58%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 21%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 13%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 69%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 80%. The overall probability of confounder active is 52%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is still present, as seen in the differences in child's intelligence probability between children with intelligent parents and those with unintelligent parents, even when controlling for parents' social status. The additional direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is not fully accounted for by the parents' social status, which means that parents' intelligence has a direct positive effect on child's intelligence that is not fully mediated by parents' social status.<|eot_id|>",
