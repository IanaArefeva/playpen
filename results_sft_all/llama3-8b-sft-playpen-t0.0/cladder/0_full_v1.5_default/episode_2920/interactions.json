The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. We know that college degree or higher causes high skill level, and we know that high skill level causes low salary. Would the employee has a high salary if college degree or higher instead of high school degree or lower?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
