Skill has a direct effect on salary. We know that college degree or higher causes high skill level, and we know that high skill level causes low salary. Would the employee has a high salary if college degree or higher instead of high school degree or lower?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The counterfactual relationship between college degree or higher and high salary is not direct; rather, it is through the intermediate relationship with skill. Since we already know that college degree or higher leads to high skill, and high skill leads to high salary, we can conclude that college degree or higher will lead to high salary.<|eot_id|>",
