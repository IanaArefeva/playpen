Weather has a direct effect on rainfall. Sprinkler has a direct effect on rainfall. For people in the dry season, the probability of high rainfall is 56%. For in the rainy season, the probability of high rainfall is 43%. Will rainy season decrease the chance of high rainfall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high rainfall is higher in the rainy season than in the dry season, which directly indicates that the weather condition is the primary cause of the difference in the probability of high rainfall. The additional relationship between the weather and the probability of high rainfall further solidifies this conclusion, as it shows that the weather condition is the direct cause of the difference in the probability of high rainfall.<|eot_id|>",
