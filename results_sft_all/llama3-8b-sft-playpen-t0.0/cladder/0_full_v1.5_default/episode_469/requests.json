Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 38%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 25%. For people taking medication, would it be more likely to see healthy heart if the person had taken no medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of blood pressure on heart condition is also negative, as higher blood pressure is associated with a lower probability of a healthy heart. Since medication directly affects heart condition and blood pressure is an intermediate variable that also affects heart condition, we need to consider the joint effect of medication and blood pressure on heart condition. In this case, the negative direct effect of medication on heart condition is likely to dominate the positive effect of lower blood pressure (caused by medication) on heart condition, leading to a lower probability of a healthy heart for people taking medication compared to those not taking medication.<|eot_id|>",
