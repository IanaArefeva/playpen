Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 21%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 35%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 85%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 99%. The overall probability of male gender is 44%.
