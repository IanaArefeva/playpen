  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 43%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 69%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 16%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 39%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 60%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 28%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 91%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 70%. The overall probability of good health is 10%. Does having a sister negatively affect infant mortality through infant's birth weight?",
