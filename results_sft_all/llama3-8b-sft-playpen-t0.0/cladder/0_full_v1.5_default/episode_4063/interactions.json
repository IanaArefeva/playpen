The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 93%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 59%. For people who speak english, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of long lifespan is higher for non-English speakers (93%) than for English speakers (59%), we can conclude that the difference in long lifespan probability is primarily due to the difference in diabetes risk, rather than any direct effect of not speaking English on long lifespan.||",
