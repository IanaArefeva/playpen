The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 44%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 61%. For areas with low cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 76%. For areas with high cigarette tax, the probability of smoking mother is 49%. Will smoking mother increase the chance of normal infant birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of normal birth weight is higher in areas with high cigarette tax, which also means that the probability of a smoking mother is lower in those areas. This suggests that the positive effect of higher cigarette tax on birth weight is not entirely due to the reduction in smoking among mothers, but rather through some other mechanism that is not directly related to maternal smoking.<|eot_id|>",
