The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 46%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 61%. Will smoking mother decrease the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
