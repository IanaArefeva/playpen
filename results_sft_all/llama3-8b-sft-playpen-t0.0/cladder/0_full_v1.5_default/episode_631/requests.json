Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between talent and being hard-working is -0.04. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does it mean that talent does not affect being hard-working?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between two variables can be negative without one directly canceling the effect of the other. In this case, the negative correlation might indicate that students who are more talented are less likely to put in extra effort, but it does not rule out the possibility that talent still exerts an independent effect on being hard-working.<|eot_id|>",
