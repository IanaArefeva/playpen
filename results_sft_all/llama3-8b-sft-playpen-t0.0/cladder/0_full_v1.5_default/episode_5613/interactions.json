The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and lip thickness. Hospital costs has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 91%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 75%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 29%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of thick lips is 16%. The overall probability of old age is 41%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be less likely to see thick lips if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the relationship between hospital costs and lip thickness is not just a direct one, but also an indirect one through the mediating variable of age. In particular, older patients are more likely to have higher hospital costs, and older patients are also less likely to have thick lips. This means that the positive relationship between hospital costs and thick lips is partially driven by the positive relationship between hospital costs and older age, which in turn is associated with lower thick lips. If we control for older age, we would see that the relationship between hospital costs and thick lips is actually negative, meaning that higher hospital costs are associated with lower thick lips. This is why, for people who pay a high hospital bill, it would not be less likely to see thick lips if the patient had paid a lower hospital bill - in fact, it would be more likely to see thick lips if the patient was older and had a lower hospital bill, since older patients are more likely to have lower hospital costs and lower thick lips.||",
