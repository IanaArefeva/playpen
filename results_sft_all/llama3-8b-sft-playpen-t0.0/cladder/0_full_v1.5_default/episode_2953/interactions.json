The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the residency is out-of-state. Would the applicant gets rejected if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that the applicant is out of state, we can conclude that the in-state residency condition is not met. The male gender condition is still present, and we have established that male gender causes a competitive department. This separate condition of male gender being present still holds, and we have no reason to conclude that the male gender condition would cancel out the effects of the in-state condition. In fact, we have a separate condition that male gender and in-state residency cause admission acceptance, which still holds in this case since male gender is present. The direct effect of male gender on competitive department is separate from the direct effect of in-state residency on competitive department, and since male gender is present, we can conclude that the applicant will still get admission acceptance.||",
