Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 78%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 77%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 21%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 47%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 45%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 78%. The overall probability of high pollution is 53%. Does gene negatively affect lung cancer through smoking?",
