The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 94%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 57%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 84%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that 0.94 * 0.84 = 0.79 of the population has a college degree and a high salary. The remaining 0.06 of the population does not have a college degree and has a 0.57 probability of having a high salary. This means that 0.06 * 0.57 = 0.0034 of the population has a high salary without a college degree. In total, 0.79 + 0.0034 = 0.7934 of the population has a high salary. The remaining 0.2066 of the population has a low salary. Since 0.7934  0.2066, high salary is more likely than low salary for the subpopulation without a college degree, but the overall probability of high salary is still less than 0.5, which means that high salary is not more likely than low salary overall.||",
