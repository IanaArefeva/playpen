Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between talent and being hard-working is -0.01. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does it mean that talent does not affect being hard-working?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The negative correlation could be due to the fact that students who are more talented might feel less need to put in extra effort, leading to a negative association between the two variables. This does not preclude the possibility that talent still exerts a direct effect on being hard-working, which is separate from the observed correlation.<|eot_id|>",
