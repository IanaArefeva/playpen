Penguin mood has a direct effect on curly hair. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 4%. The probability of taking the stairs and curly hair is 76%. The probability of taking the elevator and curly hair is 1%. Is the chance of curly hair larger when observing taking the elevator?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of taking the elevator is 4%, and the probability of taking the stairs and curly hair is 76%, it is likely that the probability of curly hair is higher when taking the stairs than when taking the elevator.<|eot_id|>",
