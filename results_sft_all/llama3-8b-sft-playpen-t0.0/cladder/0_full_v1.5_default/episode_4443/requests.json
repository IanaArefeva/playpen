The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The only link between not listening to jazz and a lower probability of lung cancer is through the intermediate link of not smoking, which is not directly related to not listening to jazz.<|eot_id|>",
