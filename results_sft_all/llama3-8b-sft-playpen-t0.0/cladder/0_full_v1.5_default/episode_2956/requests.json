The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender and in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the residency is out-of-state. Would the applicant gets admitted if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that in-state residency is out of state, we can conclude that the direct effect of male gender on competitive department is also absent. In the absence of both male gender and in-state residency, the direct effect of male gender on competitive department is not active, and the direct effect of male gender on admission status is also not active. The only active direct effect is the one from competitive department to admission status, which is not directly caused by male gender.<|eot_id|>",
