The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of having a sister is 19%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 68%. For people who have a sister, the probability of healthy heart is 40%. Is healthy heart more likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of having a sister is 19%, which means that 81% of the population does not have a sister. For this 81% of the population, the probability of a healthy heart is 68%. In contrast, for the 19% of the population that does have a sister, the probability of a healthy heart is 40%. Since the larger fraction of the population (81%) has a higher probability of a healthy heart than the fraction that has a sister (19%), we conclude that a healthy heart is more likely than heart problems overall.||",
