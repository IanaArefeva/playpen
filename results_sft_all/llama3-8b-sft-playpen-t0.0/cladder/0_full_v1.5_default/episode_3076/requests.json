The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. We know that smoking mother or good health causes normal infant birth weight. smoking mother or good health or normal infant birth weight causes high infant mortality. We observed the person has poor health. Would infant mortality is high if smoking mother instead of nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If the person's mother smoked instead of not smoking, the direct effect of the mother's smoking on the person's birth weight would still be positive (causing normal birth weight), but the person's health condition remains the same (poor health), which is the primary driver of high birth weight and high infant mortality. Since the person's health condition is unobserved and remains the same, the change in the mother's smoking status does not directly impact the person's birth weight or infant mortality.<|eot_id|>",
