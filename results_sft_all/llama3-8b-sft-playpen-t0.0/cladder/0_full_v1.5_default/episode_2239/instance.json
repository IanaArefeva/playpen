Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 93%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 60%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 63%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 34%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 98%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 91%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 56%.
