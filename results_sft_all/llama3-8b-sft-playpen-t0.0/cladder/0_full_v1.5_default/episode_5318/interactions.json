The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who do not like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 40%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 18%. For individuals who like spicy food and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 62%. For individuals who like spicy food and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 40%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 58%. For individuals who do not like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 18%. For individuals who like spicy food and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 79%. For individuals who like spicy food and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 51%. The overall probability of high skill level is 97%. Does liking spicy food negatively affect salary through occupation?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between occupation and salary is clear, but the relationship between liking spicy food and occupation is more complex. The probability of white-collar job is higher for those who like spicy food and have either high or low skill levels compared to those who do not like spicy food and have high skill levels. This suggests that the positive effect of liking spicy food on white-collar job is likely through the unobserved skill rather than a direct negative effect on occupation.||",
