The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. We know that liking spicy food and candle with wax causes dark room. We observed the candle has wax. Would the room is dark if not liking spicy food instead of liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
