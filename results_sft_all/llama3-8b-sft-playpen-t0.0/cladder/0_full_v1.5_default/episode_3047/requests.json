Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives no treatment. large kidney stone and receives treatment causes recovery.

Since the patient has a small kidney stone, we can conclude that the patient will not be subject to the \"no treatment\" condition associated with large kidney stones. The patient's small kidney stone size does not directly lead to no treatment, so the patient will likely be treated. With the patient being treated, we can conclude that the patient will likely recover, as large kidney stone and treatment cause recovery.<|eot_id|>",
