Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 29%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 20%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 63%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 28%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 61%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 54%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 97%. The overall probability of high pollution is 45%. Does gene negatively affect lung cancer through smoking?",
