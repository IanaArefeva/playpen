The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of high salary is 60%. For individuals who are male, the probability of high salary is 72%. Will male gender increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since skill is unobserved, we must consider the joint effect of male gender and skill on occupation and salary. The probability of high salary for male individuals is 72%, which is higher than the 60% probability for female individuals. This difference in probability could be due to the joint effect of male gender and skill on occupation and salary. If male gender and skill are positively correlated, then the higher probability of high salary among male individuals could be attributed to the joint effect of male gender and skill rather than male gender alone.<|eot_id|>",
