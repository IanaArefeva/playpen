The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 71%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 41%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 35%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 10%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 52%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 5%. Does encouragement level negatively affect exam score through studying habit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The exam score is higher for those who are not encouraged and do not study hard (71%) than for those who are not encouraged and study hard (41%). This suggests that the exam score is higher for those who are not encouraged, which directly contradicts the idea that encouragement would lead to a lower exam score through studying habits.<|eot_id|>",
