The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and peanut allergy. Treatment has a direct effect on peanut allergy. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 99%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 66%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 35%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 2%. The overall probability of male gender is 52%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of being allergic to peanuts?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being male and not being allergic to peanuts is 52% - 35% = 17% when not treated and 52% - 2% = 50% when treated. The probability of being male and not being allergic to peanuts is higher when treated than when not treated, which suggests that treatment does not increase the chance of being allergic to peanuts.<|eot_id|>",
