The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 51%. For people who play card games, the probability of long lifespan is 66%. For people who play card games, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not play card games?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since diabetes has a direct negative effect on long lifespan, we need to consider the relationship between card game play and diabetes. The direct relationship between card game play and diabetes is not established in the given conditions, and there is no information about the relationship between card game play and the probability of having diabetes. In the absence of any direct or indirect link between card game play and diabetes, we cannot conclude that not playing card games would lead to a lower probability of long lifespan for those who play card games.||",
