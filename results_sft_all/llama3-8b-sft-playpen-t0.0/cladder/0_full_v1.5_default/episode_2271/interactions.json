The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 15%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 54%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 4%. Is the chance of intelligent child smaller when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of intelligent child given intelligent parents is the same as the probability of intelligent child given social status of parents, which is the same as the probability of intelligent child given the unobserved other unobserved factors. The direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence is not the only path through which parents' intelligence affects child's intelligence; the social status of parents also exerts a direct effect on child's intelligence. The joint probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 4%, and the joint probability of social status of parents and intelligent child is also 4%. The joint probability of social status of parents and intelligent child is the same as the joint probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child, which is 4%. The joint probability of social status of parents and intelligent child is the same as the joint probability of other unobserved factors and intelligent child, which is 4%. The joint probability of social status of parents and intelligent child is the same as the joint probability of parents' intelligence and intelligent child, which is 4%.
