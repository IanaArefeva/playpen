The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Respiratory issues has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of respiratory issues is 84%. For people with no respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 82%. For people with respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 82%. Is broken bones more likely than no broken bones overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of respiratory issues is 84%, the number of people with no respiratory issues is 16% of the total population, and the number of people with respiratory issues is 84% of the total population. The overall probability of broken bones is the weighted average of the probabilities of broken bones for people with and without respiratory issues, which is (0.16 * 0.82) + (0.84 * 0.82) = 0.82. This is the same as the probability of broken bones for people with no respiratory issues, which is 0.82. The probability of no broken bones is 1 - 0.82 = 0.18. Since 0.82 is less than 0.5, the number of people with no broken bones is less than the number of people with broken bones, and the probability of no broken bones is less than the probability of broken bones.||",
