The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pre-conditions has a direct effect on vaccination and disease. Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 5%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 37%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 62%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 94%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 51%. For people getting the vaccine, would it be more likely to see recovering from the disease if the person had not refused the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
