The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 22%. The probability of not liking spicy food and the forest on fire is 28%. The probability of liking spicy food and the forest on fire is 14%. Is the chance of the forest on fire larger when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of not liking spicy food and the forest on fire is 28%, which is higher than the probability of liking spicy food and the forest on fire (14%). This suggests that the forest on fire is more likely when we do not see someone liking spicy food.<|eot_id|>",
