The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 11%. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 60%. For people who drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 46%. For people who drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 92%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 61%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 1%. Does drinking coffee positively affect alarm clock through wife?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is higher for those who drink coffee and have a wife who sets the alarm (92%) than for those who do not drink coffee and have a wife who sets the alarm (60%). This suggests that there is an additional direct effect of coffee consumption on the alarm clock that is not mediated by the wife.<|eot_id|>",
