The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. For people not blowing out candles, the probability of dark room is 38%. For people who blow out candles, the probability of dark room is 72%. For people who blow out candles, would it be more likely to see dark room if the person in the room had not blown out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
