The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 6%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 38%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 63%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 95%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 50%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When we condition on the patient having large kidney stones, the probability of recovery is 95% if they have not been treated and 95% if they have been treated. This means that the size of the kidney stone is the primary driver of the probability of recovery, and the treatment does not have a different effect on large kidney stones than on small kidney stones. In other words, the treatment does not conditionally change the probability of recovery for large kidney stones.<|eot_id|>",
