Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 6%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 38%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 63%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 95%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 50%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?",
