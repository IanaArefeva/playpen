Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active or close to a college causes drinking coffee. confounder active or drinking coffee causes high salary. We observed the person lives close to a college and confounder inactive.

The person's living close to a college directly affects their coffee consumption, and their coffee consumption directly affects their salary. If the person were not to drink coffee, the direct positive effect of coffee on their salary would be lost, and the only remaining direct positive effect on their salary would be the one from living close to a college. Since we already know that the person's unobserved confounder is inactive, we can conclude that the person's living close to a college is not strong enough to produce a high salary on its own.<|eot_id|>",
