Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 12%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 74%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 34%. Is admission acceptance more likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of male gender is 12%, this means that a large majority of the population (88%) is not male, and among them, the probability of admission acceptance is 74%. This higher probability of admission acceptance among the non-male population likely counterbalances the lower probability of male gender, leading to a higher overall probability of admission acceptance than rejection.<|eot_id|>",
