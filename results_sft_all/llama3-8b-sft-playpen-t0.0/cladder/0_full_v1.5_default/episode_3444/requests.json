Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For situations where there is no solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 81%. For situations where there is a solar eclipse, the probability of arriving to school on time is 48%. Will solar eclipse decrease the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This change in probability is a direct result of the solar eclipse. The direct effect of a solar eclipse on Alice's arrival time is a reduction in the probability of on-time arrival, from 81% to 48%.
