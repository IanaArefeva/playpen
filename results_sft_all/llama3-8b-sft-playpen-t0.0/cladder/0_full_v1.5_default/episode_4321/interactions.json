The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 47%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 57%. For infants with smoking mothers, would it be more likely to see freckles if the infant had a nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional information about the probability of freckles in infants with nonsmoking mothers does not change the direct relationship between maternal smoking and the probability of freckles. The probability of freckles in infants with smoking mothers is still higher than in those with nonsmoking mothers, which directly indicates that the probability of freckles is higher in the presence of maternal smoking, not in the absence of it.||",
