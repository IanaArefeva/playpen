The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and freckles. Hospital costs has a direct effect on freckles. For patients who are young and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of freckles is 12%. For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of freckles is 23%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of freckles is 82%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of freckles is 89%. The overall probability of old age is 51%. Will high hospital bill increase the chance of freckles?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of freckles is higher for older patients than for younger patients, and it is also higher for those who pay a high hospital bill than for those who pay a low hospital bill. This suggests that hospital costs might be a confounding variable rather than a direct cause of freckles. The correct relationship between hospital costs and freckles can be established by controlling for the effect of age, which is the direct cause of both hospital costs and freckles.||",
