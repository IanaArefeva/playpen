The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. For people in the dry season, the probability of wet ground is 46%. For in the rainy season, the probability of wet ground is 57%. For in the rainy season, would it be less likely to see wet ground if the season had been dry?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
