The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on black hair. Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 85%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of black hair is 58%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of black hair is 18%. Is black hair more likely than blond hair overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of tanning salon treatment is 85%, we can conclude that the overall probability of black hair is less than 58%. This is because the higher probability of tanning salon treatment (85%) dilutes the higher probability of black hair (58%) among those not using tanning salon treatments, leading to a lower overall probability of black hair.||",
