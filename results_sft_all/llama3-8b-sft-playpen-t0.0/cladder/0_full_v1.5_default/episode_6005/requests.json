Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that solar eclipse or heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is heavy traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if no solar eclipse instead of solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already have heavy traffic, which directly affects Alice's arrival, the solar eclipse's direct effect on Alice's arrival is not necessary for her to arrive on time. In other words, the solar eclipse's direct effect on Alice's arrival is redundant in this scenario, and its absence would not change the outcome of Alice's arrival time.<|eot_id|>",
