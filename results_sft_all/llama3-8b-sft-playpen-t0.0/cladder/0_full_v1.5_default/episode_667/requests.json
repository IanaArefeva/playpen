The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 32%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 92%. For students who are encouraged, would it be less likely to see high exam score if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of studying habits on exam score is also positive, meaning that higher studying habits lead to higher exam scores. Since encouragement directly affects exam score and studying habits are also directly related to exam score, we can conclude that encouragement will lead to higher exam scores, which in turn lead to higher exam habits. In this chain of cause and effect, encouragement is the primary cause of higher exam habits and exam scores. The probability of a high exam score for an encouraged student is 92%, which is higher than the 32% probability for a non-encouraged student. This shows that encouragement directly leads to higher exam habits and exam scores, rather than making it less likely to see a high exam score.<|eot_id|>",
