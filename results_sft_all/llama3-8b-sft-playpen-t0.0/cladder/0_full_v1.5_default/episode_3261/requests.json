The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 27%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 59%. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 42%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 74%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 12%. Will having visited England increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the event \"employee being fired\" given that the CEO has made a firing decision and has not visited England is 42%. The probability of the event \"employee being fired\" given that the CEO has made a firing decision and has visited England is 74%. The difference between the two probabilities is 32% (74% - 42%). The probability of the event \"CEO has made a firing decision and has not visited England\" is 88% (100% - 12%). The probability of the event \"CEO has made a firing decision and has visited England\" is 12%. The difference between the two probabilities is 76% (88% - 12%). The increase in the probability of the event \"employee being fired\" given that the CEO has made a firing decision and has not visited England compared to the probability of the event \"employee being fired\" given that the CEO has made a firing decision and has visited England is 26.4% (32% / 12%). The increase in the probability of the event \"CEO has made a firing decision and has not visited England\" compared to the probability of the event \"CEO has made a firing decision and has visited England\" is 64% (76% / 12%).
