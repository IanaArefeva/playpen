The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 23%. For normal weight people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 51%. For obese people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 52%. For obese people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 75%. For normal weight people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 80%. For normal weight people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 58%. For obese people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 51%. For obese people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 22%. The overall probability of smoker is 88%. Does obesity negatively affect lifespan through diabetes?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of having diabetes is higher for normal weight people who smoke than for normal weight people who do not smoke, and the same pattern holds for obese people. This suggests that the relationship between obesity and diabetes is likely to be spurious, being driven by the unobserved variable \"smoking\".<|eot_id|>",
