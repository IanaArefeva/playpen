Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 23%. For normal weight people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 51%. For obese people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 52%. For obese people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 75%. For normal weight people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 80%. For normal weight people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 58%. For obese people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 51%. For obese people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 22%. The overall probability of smoker is 88%. Does obesity negatively affect lifespan through diabetes?",
