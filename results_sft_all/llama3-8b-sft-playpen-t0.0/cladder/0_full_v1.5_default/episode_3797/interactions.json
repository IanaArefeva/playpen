The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to swim has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of being able to swim is 10%. For students who cannot swim, the probability of high exam score is 31%. For students who can swim, the probability of high exam score is 69%. Is high exam score more likely than low exam score overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the ability to swim directly affects exam score. The studying habits of students who can and cannot swim are not directly related to their exam scores in this world. The exam score is primarily determined by the ability to swim. Since only 10% of students can swim, the overall probability of high exam score is lower than that of low exam score.||",
