The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 66%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 84%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 60%. Is increased price more likely than reduced price overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since demand is unobserved, we must focus on the relationships between supply and price. The probability of an increased price is 84% when supply is reduced and 60% when supply is increased. The overall probability of an increased price is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is (0.66 * 0.60) + (0.34 * 0.84) = 0.5884. The probability of a reduced price is the same as the probability of an increased price, since the two are perfectly symmetric in this world. The probability of an unaltered price is the same as the probability of an unaltered supply, which is 1 - 0.66 = 0.34. The probability of an unaltered price is the same as the probability of an unaltered demand, which is 1 - 0.84 = 0.16. The probability of an unaltered demand is the same as the probability of an unaltered yield per acre, which is 1 - 0.60 = 0.40. The probability of an unaltered demand is the same as the probability of an unaltered price, which is 0.16. The probability of an unaltered demand is the same as the probability of an unaltered yield per acre, which is 0.40",
