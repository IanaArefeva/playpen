The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 7%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 68%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being a smoker is 7%, the probability of being a nonsmoker is 93%. The probability of lung cancer in the general population is then:\nP(Lung Cancer) = 0.07 * 0.79 + 0.93 * 0.68\nP(Lung Cancer) = 0.0583 + 0.6354\nP(Lung Cancer) = 0.6937\nThe probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.6937 = 0.3063. Since 0.6937 is greater than 0.3063, lung cancer is more likely than absence of lung cancer overall.<|eot_id|>",
