The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 81%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 43%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 72%. Is high salary more likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that 0.81 * 0.72 = 0.5832 of the population has a brother and a high salary. The remaining 0.19 of the population does not have a brother, and for this group, the probability of high salary is 0.43. This means that 0.19 * 0.43 = 0.0817 of the population does not have a brother and has a high salary. The probability of having a brother and a high salary is 0.5832, and the probability of not having a brother and a high salary is 0.0817. The probability of having a brother and a high salary is more than 4.5 times the probability of not having a brother and a high salary, which is a clear indication that having a brother is a strong positive predictor of having a high salary.<|eot_id|>",
