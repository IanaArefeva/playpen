The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drug taken and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on drug taken. Drug taken has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 52%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 50%. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 22%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 49%. Will taking of all assigned drugs increase the chance of low cholesterol?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of unobserved confounders on drug taken and cholesterol level is also positive, meaning that unobserved confounders should increase the chance of drug taken and, in turn, increase the chance of having low cholesterol. The direct effect of treatment assignment on drug taken is also positive, meaning that being assigned the drug treatment should increase the chance of drug taken. Since the probability of drug taken is higher for patients assigned the drug treatment than for those not assigned the drug treatment, we can conclude that drug taken should increase the chance of having low cholesterol.||",
