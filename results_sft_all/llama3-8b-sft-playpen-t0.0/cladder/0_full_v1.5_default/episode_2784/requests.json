The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of clean water is 22%. The probability of polluted water and cholera contraction is 53%. The probability of clean water and cholera contraction is 20%. Is the chance of cholera contraction smaller when observing clean water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between water quality and clean water also means that if water quality is clean, the chance of clean water is higher. The direct relationship between water quality and clean water further means that if water quality is clean, the chance of clean water is higher. The direct relationship between water quality and clean water also means that if water quality is clean, the chance of clean water is higher. The direct relationship between water quality and clean water further means that if water quality is clean, the chance of clean water is higher.<|eot_id|>",
