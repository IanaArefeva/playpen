Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between talent and being hard-working is -0.14.

The relationship between these two variables is likely spurious, as both are directly influenced by the same cause: being accepted to an elite institution. The negative correlation might stem from the fact that students who are more talented might feel less need to work hard to achieve their goals, while those who are less talented might feel more pressure to work harder to compensate for their lack of natural ability. This interpretation is supported by the direct effects of both talent and effort on elite institution admission status, which indicate that both variables are separate causes of this outcome.<|eot_id|>",
