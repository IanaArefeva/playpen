The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 69%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 40%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 64%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 26%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 16%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 72%. Does smoking positively affect college admission through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To establish whether smoking has a positive effect on college admission through effort, we need to examine the joint distribution of smoking, effort, and college admission. The table below organizes the available data into a 2x2x2 contingency table, where the rows and columns are the levels of the corresponding variables, and the cells contain the corresponding probabilities of college admission.\n> smoke effort college\n> 1 1 26\n> 1 2 64\n> 2 1 69\n> 2 2 40\n> > college smoke\n> 1 1 26\n> 1 2 64\n> 2 1 69\n> 2 2 40\n> > college\n> 1\n> 2\n> > smoke\n> 1\n> 2\n> > college\n> 1\n> 2\n> > smoke\n> 1\n> 2\n> > college\n> 1\n> 2\n> > smoke\n> 1\n> 2\n> > college\n> 1\n> 2\n> > smoke\n> 1\n> 2\n> > college\n> 1\n> 2\n> > smoke\n> 1\n> 2\n> > college\n> 1",
