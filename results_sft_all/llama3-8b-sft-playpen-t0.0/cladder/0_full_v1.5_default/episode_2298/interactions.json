The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 69%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 40%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 64%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 26%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 16%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 72%. Does smoking positively affect college admission through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
