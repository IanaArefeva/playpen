The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on curly hair. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 68%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of curly hair is 49%. Will citrus intake decrease the chance of curly hair?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key point here is that the probability of curly hair is lower for citrus consumers (49%) than for non-consumers (68%). This suggests that citrus consumption actually counteracts the positive effect of vitamin C on curly hair, rather than directly decreasing the chance of curly hair. In other words, the citrus consumption acts as a confounding variable that dilutes the positive effect of vitamin C on curly hair, leading to a lower probability of curly hair among citrus consumers.||",
