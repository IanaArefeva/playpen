Lip thickness has a direct effect on fame. For people who are famous, the correlation between attractive appearance and thick lips is -0.08. If we look at people who are famous, does it mean that attractive appearance affects thick lips?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between appearance and fame, and between lip thickness and fame, does not establish a direct link between appearance and thick lips. The negative correlation could be due to the fact that famous people with thick lips are less likely to have an attractive appearance, or that there are other intervening variables that lead to this negative relationship.<|eot_id|>",
