Since we are asked to consider the counterfactual where there is no tanning salon treatment, we need to focus on the beach visit. The beach visit is the direct cause of large feet in this scenario, and the absence of tanning salon treatment does not change the fact that the person still goes to the beach. Therefore, the person would still have large feet if no tanning salon treatment instead of tanning salon treatment.<|eot_id|>",
