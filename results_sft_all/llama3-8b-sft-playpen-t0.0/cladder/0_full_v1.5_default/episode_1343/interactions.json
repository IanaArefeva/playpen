The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 28%. For people with smoking genes, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For people with smoking genes, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had a nonsmoking gene?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The additional direct relationship between the unobserved pollution and both the gene and lung cancer further solidifies this higher risk. Since the person already has a smoking gene, the additional condition of having a nonsmoking gene does not reduce the risk of lung cancer; rather, it remains at the higher level associated with the smoking gene (40%).||",
