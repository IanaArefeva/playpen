The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that waking up late and heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is heavy traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school late if waking up late instead of waking up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we already know that heavy traffic is present and that it directly affects Alice's arrival time, we can conclude that the condition of Alice waking up late will not change the outcome of her arrival time. The primary factor determining whether she arrives late is the state of the road (heavy traffic), not her wake-up time.||",
