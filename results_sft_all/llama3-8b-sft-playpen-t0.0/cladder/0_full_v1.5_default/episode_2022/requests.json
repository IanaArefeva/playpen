Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 99%. For students who are not talented, the probability of being hard-working is 87%. For students who are talented, the probability of being hard-working is 87%. Is being hard-working less likely than being lazy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the number of hard-working students far outweighs the number of non-hard-working students, since the large number of talented students (with a 0.87 probability of being hard-working) far exceeds the number of non-talented students (with a 0.87 probability of being hard-working).<|eot_id|>",
