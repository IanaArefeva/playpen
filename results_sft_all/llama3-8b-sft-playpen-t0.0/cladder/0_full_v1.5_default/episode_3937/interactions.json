The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Respiratory issues has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Black hair has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Method 1: We look directly at how respiratory issues correlates with black hair in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to hospitalization status. To understand how respiratory issues affects black hair, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the direct relationship between respiratory issues and hospitalization status, as well as the direct relationship between black hair and hospitalization status, imply that the relationship between respiratory issues and black hair is likely to vary depending on the hospitalization status. In other words, the joint effect of respiratory issues and black hair on hospitalization status is not a direct one, and looking at the correlation case by case is necessary to disentangle the separate effects of each variable.||",
