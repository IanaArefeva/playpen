The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 85%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 64%. For obese people, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person had been normal weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of long lifespan for normal weight people is 85%, and for obese people is 64%. The key point here is that the condition of being normal weight does not directly influence the probability of long lifespan for an individual who is already obese. The direct relationship between being normal weight and having a long lifespan is separate from the condition of being obese, and the probability of long lifespan for an individual who is already obese is determined by their condition of being obese, not by their condition of being normal weight.<|eot_id|>",
