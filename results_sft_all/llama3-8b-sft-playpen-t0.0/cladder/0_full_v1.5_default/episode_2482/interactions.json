The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 38%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 26%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 75%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of treatment is 38%, and the probability of non-treatment is 62%. To find the overall probability of recovery, we need to consider both the probability of treatment and the probability of non-treatment. The overall probability of recovery is the sum of the probability of recovery given treatment (75%) and the probability of recovery given non-treatment (26%), each weighted by the corresponding probability of treatment (38%) and non-treatment (62%).\nOverall probability of recovery: (0.38 * 0.75) + (0.62 * 0.26) = 0.285 + 0.1614 = 0.4464\nOverall probability of non-recovery: 1 - 0.4464 = 0.5536\nSince the overall probability of non-recovery (0.5536) is higher than the overall probability of recovery (0.4464), we conclude that, in this world, non-recovery is more likely than recovery overall.||",
