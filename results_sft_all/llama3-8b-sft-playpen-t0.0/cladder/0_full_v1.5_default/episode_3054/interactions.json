The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. We know that large kidney stone causes receives treatment. large kidney stone or receives treatment causes recovery. We observed the patient has a large kidney stone. Would the patient doesn't recover if receives treatment instead of receives no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between treatment and recovery is that treatment causes recovery. Since we already know that the patient has a large kidney stone, we can conclude that the patient will receive treatment. Then, since treatment causes recovery, we can conclude that the patient will recover. The specific condition of whether the patient \"receives no treatment\" is not directly related to the patient's kidney stone size or the patient's recovery. The key relationships are that large kidney stone size leads to treatment, and treatment leads to recovery.||",
