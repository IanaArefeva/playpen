The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 37%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 54%. Will having a brother decrease the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high salary is higher for people who have a brother (54%) than for those who do not (37%). This suggests that having a brother is not a barrier to higher salary, but rather a factor that contributes to higher skill and, by extension, higher salary.<|eot_id|>",
