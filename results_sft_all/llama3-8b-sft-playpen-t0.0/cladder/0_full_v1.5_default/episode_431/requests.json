Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 56%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 49%. Will vaccination decrease the chance of smallpox survival?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This might imply that vaccination could reduce the chance of smallpox survival.<|eot_id|>",
