Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 88%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 72%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 16%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 4%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 41%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?",
