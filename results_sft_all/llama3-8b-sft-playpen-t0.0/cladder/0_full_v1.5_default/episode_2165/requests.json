The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who are not male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 67%. For individuals who are not male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 46%. For individuals who are male and blue-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 42%. For individuals who are male and white-collar workers, the probability of high salary is 23%. For individuals who are not male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 99%. For individuals who are not male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 70%. For individuals who are male and with low skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 64%. For individuals who are male and with high skill levels, the probability of white-collar job is 38%. The overall probability of high skill level is 92%. Does gender positively affect salary through occupation?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between \"gender\" and \"salary\" is not fully accounted for by the direct relationship between \"gender\" and \"occupation\" and the direct relationship between \"occupation\" and \"salary\". The counterfactuals in the table do not support a direct positive relationship between \"gender\" and \"salary\" through \"occupation\".<|eot_id|>",
