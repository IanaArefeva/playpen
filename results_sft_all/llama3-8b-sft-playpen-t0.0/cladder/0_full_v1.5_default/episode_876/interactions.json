The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 35%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 35%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 69%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 70%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 57%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 69%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 35%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 28%. The overall probability of confounder active is 60%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would parents' intelligence negatively affect child's intelligence?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The confounder active condition further blurs the relationship between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence, but it does not change the sign of the direct relationship. The cross-tabulations of child's intelligence by parents' intelligence and social status also reveal that children of intelligent parents are more likely to be intelligent than children of unintelligent parents, both in the active and inactive confounder scenarios. This pattern of positive relationships between parents' intelligence and child's intelligence holds across different social status and confounder scenarios, which suggests that parents' intelligence has a positive direct effect on child's intelligence, rather than a negative one.||",
