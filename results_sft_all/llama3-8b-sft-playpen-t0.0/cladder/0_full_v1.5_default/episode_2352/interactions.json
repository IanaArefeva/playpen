The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 64%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 72%. Will citrus intake increase the chance of scurvy?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of scurvy is higher for citrus consumers (72%) than for non-consumers (64%), which might lead one to conclude that citrus consumption directly increases the chance of scurvy. However, this increase in probability could be due to the direct relationship between citrus consumption and vitamin C, rather than a direct relationship between citrus consumption and scurvy. In other words, citrus consumption might lead to higher levels of vitamin C, which in turn lead to a higher probability of scurvy. This chain of causality means that citrus consumption does not directly increase the chance of scurvy; rather, it does so through its effect on vitamin C.||",
