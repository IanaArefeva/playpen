The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 91%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 84%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 84%. Is talent less likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of being unattractive is 9% and the probability of being attractive is 91%, the overall probability of having talent is a weighted average of the two groups, which is still 84%. This is because the 9% of unattractive people with a 84% chance of having talent do not change the overall probability of having talent, which remains the same as the 91% of attractive people with an 84% chance of having talent.||",
