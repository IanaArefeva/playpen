The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having visited England has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. For individuals who have not visited England, the probability of high salary is 31%. For individuals who have visited England, the probability of high salary is 65%. Will having visited England increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since skill is unobserved, we cannot conclude that the increase in the probability of high salary among those who have visited England is entirely due to the direct effect of having visited England on occupation and salary. The increase in the probability of high salary among those who have visited England might also be partially due to the direct effect of skill on occupation and salary, which is not accounted for in the given conditions.||",
