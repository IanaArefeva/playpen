The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking mother is 10%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 49%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of freckles is 61%. Is freckles more likely than no freckles overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of freckles is higher in the case of a smoking mother than in the case of a nonsmoking mother, we can conclude that the direct relationship between maternal smoking and freckles is the primary driver of the overall probability of freckles. The health condition, being unobserved, does not directly influence the probability of freckles. The positive direct relationship between birth weight and freckles further solidifies the idea that the direct relationship between maternal smoking and freckles is the primary driver of the overall probability of freckles.||",
