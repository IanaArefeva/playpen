The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Personality has a direct effect on relationship status. Appearance has a direct effect on relationship status. The overall probability of kindness is 5%. For people with mean personalities and single people, the probability of attractive appearance is 92%. For people with mean personalities and in a relationship, the probability of attractive appearance is 73%. For people with kind personalities and single people, the probability of attractive appearance is 86%. For people with kind personalities and in a relationship, the probability of attractive appearance is 71%. If we look at people in a relationship, does the chance of attractive appearance increase when kindness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
