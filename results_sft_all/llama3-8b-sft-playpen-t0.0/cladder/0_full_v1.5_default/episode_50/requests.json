The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 29%. The probability of not blowing out the candle and dark room is 27%. The probability of blowing out the candle and dark room is 21%. Is the chance of dark room smaller when observing blowing out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a dark room is the same in both scenarios (21% and 27% respectively), which means that the chance of a dark room is not smaller when observing the candle being blown out.<|eot_id|>",
