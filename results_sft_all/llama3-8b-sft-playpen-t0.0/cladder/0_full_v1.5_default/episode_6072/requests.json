Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active or close to a college causes drinking coffee. confounder active or drinking coffee causes high salary. We observed the person lives far from a college and confounder inactive. Would the employee has a high salary if drinking coffee instead of not drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The person's living far from a college means that the direct effect of the college on the person's coffee consumption is also zero. The person's coffee consumption is determined by the active confounder, which has a direct effect on the person's salary. If the person were to drink coffee, the direct effect of the active confounder on the person's salary would still be present, and the person's salary would still be high.<|eot_id|>",
