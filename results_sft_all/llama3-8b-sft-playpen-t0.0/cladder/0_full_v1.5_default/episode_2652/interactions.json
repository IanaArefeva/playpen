The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 57%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 18%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 59%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 22%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 80%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 3%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a high tar deposit for a smoker is 3%. Since the probability of a high tar deposit is so low for a smoker, the overall probability of lung cancer for a smoker is more likely to be close to the 59% associated with no tar deposit than the 22% associated with a high tar deposit.||",
