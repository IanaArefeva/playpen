Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 44%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 54%. Does education level positively affect salary through skill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, there might be additional, unexplored relationships that link education level to salary, which are not accounted for in the given conditions. For instance, there could be a direct link between education level and salary that is not mediated by skill.
