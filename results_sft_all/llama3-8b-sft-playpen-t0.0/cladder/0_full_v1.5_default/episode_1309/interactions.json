The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 29%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 43%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of smoke is 29%, and the probability of lung cancer among smoke is 42%, the overall probability of lung cancer is less than 29% (29% of 42% is 12.18%). The probability of absence of lung cancer is 1 - 0.42 = 0.58, which is higher than the probability of smoke (0.29), and higher than the probability of lung cancer (0.42).||",
