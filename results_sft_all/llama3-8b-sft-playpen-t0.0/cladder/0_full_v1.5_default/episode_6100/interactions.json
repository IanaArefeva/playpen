The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender and in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes brown eyes. We observed the residency is out-of-state. Would the applicant has blue eyes if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the applicant is male and we already know that the residency is out-of-state, we need to consider the relationship between male gender and brown eyes in the absence of in-state residency. The direct relationship between male gender and brown eyes is not established in this condition, and the only direct relationship between male gender and brown eyes is through the condition that male gender and in-state residency and competitive department cause brown eyes. Since the applicant is male and the residency is out-of-state, we conclude that the direct relationship between male gender and brown eyes is not established, and the applicant would not have brown eyes.||",
