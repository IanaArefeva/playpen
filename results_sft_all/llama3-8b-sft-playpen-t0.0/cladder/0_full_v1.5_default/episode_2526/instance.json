Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 87%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 73%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 22%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 4%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 45%. Will getting the vaccine decrease the chance of recovering from the disease?",
