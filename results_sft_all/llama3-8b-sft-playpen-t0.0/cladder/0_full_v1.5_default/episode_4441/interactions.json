The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 19%. The probability of not listening to jazz and lung cancer is 37%. The probability of listening to jazz and lung cancer is 10%. Is the chance of lung cancer smaller when observing listening to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the direct effect of jazz on lung cancer is not as pronounced as the direct effect of not listening to jazz on lung cancer. The direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is also not as strong as the direct relationship between smoke and lung cancer, which is a given condition in the problem.||",
