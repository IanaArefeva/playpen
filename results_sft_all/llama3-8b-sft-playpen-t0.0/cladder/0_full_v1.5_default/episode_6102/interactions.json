The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender and in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes brown eyes. We observed the resident is in-state. Would the applicant has blue eyes if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
