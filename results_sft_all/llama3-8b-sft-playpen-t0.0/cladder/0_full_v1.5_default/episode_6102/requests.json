Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and brown eyes. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on brown eyes. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender and in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes brown eyes. We observed the resident is in-state. Would the applicant has blue eyes if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that the in-state resident is male and in a competitive department, we can conclude that the male individual has brown eyes. If the male individual has brown eyes, then we can conclude that the male individual does not have blue eyes.<|eot_id|>",
