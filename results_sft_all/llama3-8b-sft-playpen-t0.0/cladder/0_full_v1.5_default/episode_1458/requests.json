Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 74%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 21%. For husbands that set the alarm, would it be more likely to see ringing alarm if the husband had not set the alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This directly indicates that setting the alarm by the husband has a negative effect on the probability of the alarm clock ringing. If the husband set the alarm, it would not be more likely to see the alarm clock ringing; rather, it would be less likely.<|eot_id|>",
