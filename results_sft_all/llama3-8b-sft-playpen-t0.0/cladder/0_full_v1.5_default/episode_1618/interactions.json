The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The captain has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. The overall probability of the captain's order to execute the prisoner is 16%. For captains who release prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 29%. For captains who execute prisoners, the probability of the prisoner's death is 81%. Is the prisoner's death more likely than the prisoner being alive overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that there is a 16% chance that the captain will order the execution, and a 84% chance that the captain will not order the execution. If the captain does not order the execution, the probability of the prisoner's death is 0, since the captain's decision directly affects the fate of the prisoner. If the captain does order the execution, the probability of the prisoner's death is 81%. To find the overall probability of the prisoner's death, we need to consider both scenarios: the captain ordering the execution and the captain not ordering the execution. The overall probability of the prisoner's death is the sum of the products of the probability of each scenario and the probability of the prisoner's death in that scenario: (16% * 81%) + (84% * 0) = 12.96%. Since 12.96% is less than 50%, the probability of the prisoner's death is less than 50%, and the probability of the prisoner being alive is higher than the probability of the prisoner's death.||",
