The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The camper has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. For campers who do not light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 95%. For campers who light a match, the probability of the forest on fire is 60%. Will the camper lighting a match increase the chance of the forest on fire?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the forest on fire is primarily determined by the actions of the smoker, not the camper. The probability of the forest on fire is 95% for non-smokers and 60% for smokers, which means the smoker's action has a more significant impact on the forest's condition than the camper's action. The camper's action of lighting a match does not directly increase the chance of the forest on fire; rather, it shifts the probability from 95% to 60%, which still places the forest at risk of being on fire.||",
