Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active and close to a college causes drinking coffee. confounder active or drinking coffee causes high salary. We observed the person lives far from a college and confounder inactive.

The person's living far from a college means that the direct effect of living far from a college on the person's coffee consumption is also zero. The person's coffee consumption is determined by the direct effect of the unobserved confounder on the person's coffee consumption, which is also zero since the confounder is inactive. Finally, the person's salary is determined by the direct effect of the person's coffee consumption on the person's salary, which is also zero since the person does not drink coffee.<|eot_id|>",
