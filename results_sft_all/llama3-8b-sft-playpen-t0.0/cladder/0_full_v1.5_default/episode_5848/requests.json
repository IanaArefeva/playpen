Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 73%. For people who have a sister, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person did not have a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer is higher for people who have a sister (73%) than for those who do not (33%). This difference in probability is not a result of the person's relationship with their sister but rather a separate condition that is associated with having a sister. If we consider a person who does not have a sister, we are looking at a separate condition that is not directly related to the person's relationship with their sister. The probability of lung cancer for this person is still 33%, which is lower than the probability for someone who has a sister (73%).<|eot_id|>",
