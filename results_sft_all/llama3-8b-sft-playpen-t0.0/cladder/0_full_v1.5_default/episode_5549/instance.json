  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on full moon and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on full moon. Full moon has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 51%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 42%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of full moon is 73%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of full moon is 45%. Will full moon increase the chance of increased price?",
