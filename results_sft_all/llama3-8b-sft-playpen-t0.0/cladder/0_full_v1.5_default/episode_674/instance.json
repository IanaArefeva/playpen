For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 55%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 71%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 95%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 20%.
