The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 26%. For students who are not encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 55%. For students who are encouraged and do not study hard, the probability of high exam score is 71%. For students who are encouraged and study hard, the probability of high exam score is 95%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 20%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of studying hard is 72%. If we disregard the mediation effect through studying habit, would encouragement level positively affect exam score?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a high exam score is lower for students who are not encouraged (26%) than for students who are not encouraged but study hard (55%). This suggests that the direct effect of encouragement on exam score is negative.<|eot_id|>",
