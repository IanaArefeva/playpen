The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 81%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 60%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 66%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that a large majority of the population (81%) has a college degree or higher, and among them, a sizeable fraction (66%) has a high salary. In contrast, for those without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 60%. Since the number of people with a college degree far exceeds the number of people without one, the overall probability of high salary is likely to be higher than that of low salary.<|eot_id|>",
