Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of solar eclipse is 48%. The probability of no solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 49%. The probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 15%. Is the chance of arriving to school on time larger when observing solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the probability of no solar eclipse is 52%. The probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 15%. To find the probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time, we need to consider the joint probability of solar eclipse and no solar eclipse. The joint probability of solar eclipse and no solar eclipse is the product of their individual probabilities, which is 0.48 * 0.52 = 0.2496. The probability of no solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 0.52 * 0.49 = 0.2548. Since 0.2548 is larger than 0.2496, the chance of arriving to school on time is larger when there is no solar eclipse.<|eot_id|>",
