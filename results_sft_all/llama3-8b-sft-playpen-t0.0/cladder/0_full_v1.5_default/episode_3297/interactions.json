The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on the private and the corporal. The corporal has a direct effect on prisoner. The private has a direct effect on prisoner. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 34%. For people who have a sister, the probability of the prisoner's death is 80%. Will having a sister decrease the chance of the prisoner's death?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The corporal and the private also have direct effects on the prisoner's death. Since the corporal and the private are not directly related to having a sister, we need to consider their separate effects on the prisoner's death. If the corporal and the private have a higher probability of the prisoner's death than the general 34% for those without a sister, then having a sister might not be the primary factor decreasing the chance of the prisoner's death.||",
