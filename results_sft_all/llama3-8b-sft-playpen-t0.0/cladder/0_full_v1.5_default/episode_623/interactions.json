The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 58%. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 30%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 64%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of high salary is higher for those with a college degree (64%) than for those without (30%). This suggests that having a college degree is associated with a higher likelihood of having a high salary. The unobserved confounders also have a direct effect on both education level and salary, which could further increase the likelihood of high salary among those with a college degree.||",
