Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 98%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 67%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 41%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 10%. The overall probability of male gender is 43%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?",
