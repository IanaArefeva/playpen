The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 33%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 62%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 19%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 52%. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 34%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 70%. For smokers, would it be more likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of having high tar deposit for a smoker is 70%. Since the probability of being allergic to peanuts is higher with high tar deposit than with no tar deposit, and the probability of having high tar deposit is higher for a smoker than for a nonsmoker, it is more likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the person is a smoker than if they are a nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
