Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 72%. For people who have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 56%.

The probability of lung cancer is lower for people who have a brother (56%) compared to those who do not have a brother (72%), which might imply that having a brother could reduce the chance of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
