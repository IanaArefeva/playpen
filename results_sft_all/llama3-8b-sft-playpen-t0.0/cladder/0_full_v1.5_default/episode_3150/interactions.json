The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 66%. The probability of not drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 14%. The probability of drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 31%. Is the chance of ringing alarm smaller when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of not drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 14% of the total probability of not drinking coffee, which is 0.34. The probability of not drinking coffee and not ringing alarm is 0.34 - 0.14 = 0.20. The probability of not ringing alarm is 1 - 0.31 = 0.69. The probability of not drinking coffee and not ringing alarm is 0.20, which is less than the probability of not ringing alarm (0.69), and the probability of not drinking coffee and not ringing alarm is also less than the probability of not drinking coffee (0.34). This suggests that the chance of not ringing alarm is lower than the chance of not drinking coffee, and the chance of not ringing alarm is lower than the chance of not drinking coffee and not ringing alarm. This pattern of relationships between the different probabilities suggests that the chance of not ringing alarm is lower than the chance of not drinking coffee, and the chance of not ringing alarm is lower than the chance of not drinking coffee and not ringing alarm.||",
