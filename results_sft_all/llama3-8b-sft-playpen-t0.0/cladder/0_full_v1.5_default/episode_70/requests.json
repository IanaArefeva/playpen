The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 26%. The probability of not blowing out the candle and dark room is 41%. The probability of blowing out the candle and dark room is 22%. Is the chance of dark room larger when observing blowing out the candle?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of a dark room is 22% when the candle is blown out and 41% when the candle is not blown out. The difference in probability is due to the different scenarios (candle blown out or not) rather than the state of the room (dark or light).<|eot_id|>",
