The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 2%. The probability of non-male gender and high salary is 45%. The probability of male gender and high salary is 1%. Is the chance of high salary smaller when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between male gender and occupation is also not strong, as the probability of male gender is only 2%. The direct relationship between occupation and high salary is strong, as the probability of non-male gender and high salary is 45%. The direct relationship between skill and occupation is also strong, as skill has a direct effect on occupation. Since the direct relationships between male gender and both occupation and high salary are not strong, the chance of high salary is not smaller when observing male gender.<|eot_id|>",
