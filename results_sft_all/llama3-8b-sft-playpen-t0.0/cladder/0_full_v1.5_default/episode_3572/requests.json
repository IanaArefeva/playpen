The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 45%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 58%. Does having a brother negatively affect smallpox survival through getting smallpox and vaccination reaction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship is established by the condition that having a brother directly affects smallpox survival, and this relationship is not dependent on the intermediate variables.<|eot_id|>",
