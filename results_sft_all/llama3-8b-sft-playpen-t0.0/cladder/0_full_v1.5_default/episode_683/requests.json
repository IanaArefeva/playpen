The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. The overall probability of encouragement is 45%. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 21%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 87%. Is high exam score more likely than low exam score overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of a high exam score is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.3925 + 0.1155 = 0.508. The probability of a low exam score is 1 - 0.508 = 0.492. Since 0.492 is greater than 0.508, a high exam score is less likely than a low exam score overall.<|eot_id|>",
