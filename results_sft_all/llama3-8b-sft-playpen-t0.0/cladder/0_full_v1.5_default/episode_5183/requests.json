Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of brown eyes is 65%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of brown eyes is 62%. Will encouragement decrease the chance of brown eyes?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This does not imply that encouragement directly affects the occurrence of brown eyes; rather, it suggests that encouragement is associated with a lower likelihood of brown eyes. The direct relationship between studying habits and brown eyes is that studying habits lead to a higher probability of brown eyes. Since encouragement is associated with higher studying habits, and higher studying habits lead to a higher probability of brown eyes, it can be concluded that encouragement is associated with a higher probability of brown eyes, not a lower one.<|eot_id|>",
