The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on maternal smoking status and brown eyes. Cigarette tax has a direct effect on maternal smoking status. Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on brown eyes. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how maternal smoking status correlates with brown eyes case by case according to unobserved confounders. Method 2: We look directly at how maternal smoking status correlates with brown eyes in general. To understand how maternal smoking status affects brown eyes, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key issue is that there are unobserved confounders that directly affect both maternal smoking status and brown eyes. This means that any direct relationship between maternal smoking status and brown eyes could be spurious, as it might be driven by the unobserved confounders rather than a direct causal link. Method 1, which looks at the relationship case by case according to unobserved confounders, is more appropriate in this situation. This is because it controls for the unobserved confounders, which are the primary concern here. In contrast, Method 2 looks at the general relationship between maternal smoking status and brown eyes without accounting for the unobserved confounders, which could lead to spurious conclusions.||",
