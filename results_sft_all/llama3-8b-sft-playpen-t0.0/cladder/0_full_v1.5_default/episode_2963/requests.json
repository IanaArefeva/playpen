The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender or in-state residency or competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the resident is in-state. Would the applicant gets rejected if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that in-state residency is the cause of competitive department, and we have no information that male gender supersedes in-state residency in this relationship, we can conclude that male gender does not directly lead to a competitive department in this specific context. The chain of causality is as follows: in-state residency (unobserved) -> competitive department (observed) -> admission acceptance (observed). Male gender does not directly lead to a competitive department, and its effect on admission acceptance is already accounted for by the chain of causality through in-state residency and competitive department.<|eot_id|>",
