Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 90%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 79%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 13%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 0%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 40%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?",
