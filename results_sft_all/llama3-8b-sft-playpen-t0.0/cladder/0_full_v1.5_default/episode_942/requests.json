The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 91%. For normal weight people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 59%. For obese people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 59%. For obese people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 35%. For normal weight people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 26%. For normal weight people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 67%. For obese people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 56%. For obese people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 92%. The overall probability of smoker is 15%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would obesity negatively affect lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of long lifespan for normal weight people and without diabetes is 91%, and for normal weight people and with diabetes is 59%. The probability of long lifespan for obese people and without diabetes is 59%, and for obese people and with diabetes is 35%. The direct relationship between obesity and lifespan is not immediately obvious from these numbers, and we need more information to conclude whether obesity has a negative effect on lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
