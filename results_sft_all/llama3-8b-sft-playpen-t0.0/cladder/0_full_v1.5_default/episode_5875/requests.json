The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of having a sister is 96%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 33%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 47%. Is lung cancer less likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the majority of the population (96%) has a higher risk of lung cancer (47%) compared to the minority without a sister (4%) who have a lower risk of lung cancer (33%). Since the overall probability of lung cancer is higher than the probability of absence of lung cancer, we conclude that lung cancer is more likely than absence of lung cancer overall.<|eot_id|>",
