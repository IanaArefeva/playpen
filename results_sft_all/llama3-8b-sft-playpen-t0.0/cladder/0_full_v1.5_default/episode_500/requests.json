Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 49%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 12%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 12%.

Since the probability of being unattractive is 49%, and the probability of being attractive is 51%, the overall probability of having talent is the same as the probability of being unattractive (12%). This is because the two groups are equal in size, and the probability of having talent is the same in both groups.<|eot_id|>",
