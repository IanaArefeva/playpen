  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 59%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 29%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 33%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 4%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 74%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 72%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 45%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 26%. The overall probability of confounder active is 42%. If we disregard the mediation effect through parents' social status, would parents' intelligence negatively affect lactose intolerance?",
