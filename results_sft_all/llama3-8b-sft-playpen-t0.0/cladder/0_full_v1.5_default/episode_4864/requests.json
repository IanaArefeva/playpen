Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 5%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of high rainfall is 46%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of high rainfall is 78%. Is high rainfall less likely than low rainfall overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When Alice wakes up on time, the probability of high rainfall is 46%, which is lower than the 78% probability of high rainfall when she wakes up late. This indicates that Alice's on-time wake-up is associated with lower rainfall likelihood. Since the probability of Alice waking up late is only 5%, the overall probability of high rainfall is still higher than that of low rainfall, which is 55% (100% - 45% - 5%).<|eot_id|>",
