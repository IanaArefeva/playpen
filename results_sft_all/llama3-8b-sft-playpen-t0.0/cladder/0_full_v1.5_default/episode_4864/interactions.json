The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 5%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of high rainfall is 46%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of high rainfall is 78%. Is high rainfall less likely than low rainfall overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

When Alice wakes up on time, the probability of high rainfall is 46%, which is lower than the 78% probability of high rainfall when she wakes up late. This indicates that Alice's on-time wake-up is associated with lower rainfall likelihood. Since the probability of Alice waking up late is only 5%, the overall probability of high rainfall is still higher than that of low rainfall, which is 55% (100% - 45% - 5%).||",
