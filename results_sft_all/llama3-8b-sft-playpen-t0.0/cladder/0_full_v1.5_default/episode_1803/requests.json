Penguin mood has a direct effect on penguin survival. The overall probability of taking the elevator is 19%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin death is 82%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin death is 30%. Is penguin death less likely than penguin lives overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of taking the stairs is 81% (100% - 19%) and the probability of taking the elevator is 19%, we can weight the probabilities of penguin death by the corresponding probabilities of taking the stairs and the elevator. The overall probability of penguin death is then (0.81 * 0.82) + (0.19 * 0.30) = 0.6612 + 0.057 = 0.7182. The probability of penguin lives is 1 - 0.7182 = 0.2818. Since 0.7182 is greater than 0.2818, penguin death is more likely than penguin lives overall.<|eot_id|>",
