Effort has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of smoking is 84%. For nonsmokers, the probability of freckles is 63%. For smokers, the probability of freckles is 57%.

This indicates that smoking has a negative effect on the likelihood of having freckles. The direct relationship between effort and freckles is that higher effort leads to a higher probability of freckles. Since the overall probability of smoking is 84%, the large majority of the population is smokers, and the negative effect of smoking on freckles likely supersedes the positive effect of higher effort on freckles. This suggests that the overall probability of having freckles is lower than the probability of not having freckles.<|eot_id|>",
