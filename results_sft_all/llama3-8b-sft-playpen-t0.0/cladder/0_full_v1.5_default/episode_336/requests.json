Going to the beach has a direct effect on skin. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 5%. The probability of no tanning salon treatment and tanned skin is 6%. The probability of tanning salon treatment and tanned skin is 3%. Is the chance of tanned skin smaller when observing tanning salon treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
