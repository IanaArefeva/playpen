Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. We know that smoking causes high tar deposit, and we know that high tar deposit causes absence of lung cancer.

The correct chain of causality is: Smoking -> high tar deposit -> absence of lung cancer. If the person were a nonsmoker, the chain of causality would be: Nonsmoking -> lower tar deposit (or no tar deposit) -> lung cancer. This separate chain of causality shows that the person could still have lung cancer if they were a nonsmoker, as the absence of lung cancer is not a direct result of not smoking.<|eot_id|>",
