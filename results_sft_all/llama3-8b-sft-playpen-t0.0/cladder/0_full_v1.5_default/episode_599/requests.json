Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people without a college degree, the probability of high salary is 47%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of high salary is 61%. For people with a college degree or higher, would it be less likely to see high salary if the person had not had a college degree?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that having a college degree or higher directly leads to a higher probability of having a high salary. If we condition on having a college degree or higher, the probability of a high salary remains the same (61%) whether or not the person had a college degree. This is because the college degree is already accounted for in the condition, and the additional information about not having a college degree does not change the probability of a high salary.<|eot_id|>",
