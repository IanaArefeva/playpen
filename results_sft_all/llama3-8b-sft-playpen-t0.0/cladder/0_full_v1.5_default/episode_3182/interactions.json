The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 3%. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 50%. For people who drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 50%. For people who drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 97%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 63%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 84%. Does drinking coffee positively affect alarm clock through wife?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is higher for those who drink coffee than for those who do not, which suggests a direct effect of coffee on the alarm clock. The wife's behavior does not fully account for this difference, as the probability of the alarm clock ringing is still higher for those who drink coffee than for those who do not, even when the wife does not set the alarm.||",
