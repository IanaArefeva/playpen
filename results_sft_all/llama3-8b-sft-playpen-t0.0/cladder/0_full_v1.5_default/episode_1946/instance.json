The overall probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 16%. The probability of not taking of any assigned drugs and low cholesterol is 49%. The probability of taking of all assigned drugs and low cholesterol is 7%. Is the chance of low cholesterol smaller when observing taking of all assigned drugs?",
