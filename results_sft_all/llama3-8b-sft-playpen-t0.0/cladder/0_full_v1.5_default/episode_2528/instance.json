Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. For people with no pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 94%. For people with no pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 74%. For people with pre-conditions and refusing the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 24%. For people with pre-conditions and getting the vaccine, the probability of recovering from the disease is 3%. The overall probability of pre-conditions is 42%. For people getting the vaccine, would it be less likely to see recovering from the disease if the person had not refused the vaccine?",
