The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 80%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 3%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 57%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 18%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 59%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 22%. The overall probability of smoking is 75%. Will smoking decrease the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the given world, the probability of lung cancer is higher for both nonsmokers and smokers when there is no tar deposit (57% for nonsmokers and 59% for smokers) than when there is a high tar deposit (18% for nonsmokers and 22% for smokers). This suggests that the presence of a high tar deposit could reduce the risk of lung cancer for both groups. Since the probability of high tar deposit is 3% for smokers and 80% for nonsmokers, the overall risk of lung cancer is likely higher for nonsmokers than for smokers, given the higher probability of high tar deposit among nonsmokers.||",
