The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 10%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 23%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 84%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 96%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 43%. Will receives treatment increase the chance of recovery?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of kidney stone size on treatment and recovery is clear, but we need to carefully consider the counterfactuals to answer the question.\n\nLet's first examine the counterfactuals for the large kidney stone group. If a patient with a large kidney stone does not receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 84%. If the same patient with a large kidney stone does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 96%. This shows that treatment has a positive effect on recovery for large kidney stone patients, increasing the probability of recovery by 12%.\n\nNext, we need to consider the counterfactuals for the small kidney stone group. If a patient with a small kidney stone does not receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 10%. If the same patient with a small kidney stone does receive treatment, the probability of recovery is 23%. This shows that treatment has a positive effect on recovery for small kidney stone patients, increasing the probability of recovery by 13%.\n\nHowever, the question is whether Will's kidney stone size is large or small. Since the overall probability of large kidney stone is 43%, we can conclude that Will is more likely to have a large kidney stone than a small one. If Will has a large kidney stone, the positive effect of treatment on recovery is 12%. If Will has a small kidney stone, the positive effect of treatment on",
