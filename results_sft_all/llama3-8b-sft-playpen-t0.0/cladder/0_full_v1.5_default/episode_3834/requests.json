The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 46%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 67%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In other words, the higher probability of being allergic to peanuts among males is already accounted for by the direct relationship between being male and having a higher probability of being allergic to peanuts. If we condition on being male, the additional information that the individual is not male does not provide any new information that would change the probability of being allergic to peanuts.<|eot_id|>",
