The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of receives treatment is 49%. The probability of receives no treatment and recovery is 42%. The probability of receives treatment and recovery is 21%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing receives treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of both treatment and recovery is 21%, which is lower than the probability of no treatment and recovery (42%). This suggests that the positive effect of treatment on recovery is offset by the negative effect of treatment on the probability of no recovery. In other words, the higher probability of treatment is associated with a lower probability of no recovery, which in turn affects the overall probability of recovery.||",
