The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 76%. The probability of reduced supply and increased price is 11%. The probability of increased supply and increased price is 51%. Is the chance of increased price larger when observing increased supply?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between demand and price is not directly observable in this world, and demand is unobserved.\n2.

The direct relationship between supply and price is the only direct relationship that is observable in this world.\n4.
