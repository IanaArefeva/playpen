The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. The overall probability of having a brother is 92%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 29%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 56%. Is high salary less likely than low salary overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The higher probability of high salary among those with a brother (56%) compared to those without a brother (29%) further supports this positive relationship. Since the probability of having a brother is 92%, the large majority of the population will have a brother, which in turn will lead to a higher likelihood of high salary. This suggests that high salary is more likely than low salary overall.||",
