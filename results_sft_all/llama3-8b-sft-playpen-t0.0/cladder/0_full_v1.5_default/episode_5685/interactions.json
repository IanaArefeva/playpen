The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 60%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 86%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 36%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 61%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 43%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 14%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 71%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 49%. The overall probability of good health is 15%. Does having a sister negatively affect infant mortality through infant's birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between having a sister and infant's birth weight is not clear from the given information. The probability of normal birth weight for those with a sister and with good health is 49%, which is higher than the 43% for those without a sister and with good health, but lower than the 71% for those with a sister and with poor health. This pattern does not support a direct negative effect of having a sister on birth weight. The direct relationship between having a sister and infant's birth weight is not clear from the given information, and the relationship is likely to be through health condition.||",
