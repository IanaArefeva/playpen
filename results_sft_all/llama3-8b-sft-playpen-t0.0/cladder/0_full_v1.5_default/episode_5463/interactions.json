The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of playing card games is 85%. The probability of not playing card games and long lifespan is 10%. The probability of playing card games and long lifespan is 42%. Is the chance of long lifespan larger when observing playing card games?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In fact, the direct relationship between card games and diabetes could imply that card games lead to a higher risk of diabetes, which in turn could lead to a lower chance of a long lifespan. The correct relationship between card games and long lifespan can be established by looking at the joint probability of card games and long lifespan, which is 42%, and the probability of not card games and long lifespan, which is 10%. The difference between these two probabilities is 32%, which is a measure of the positive association between card games and long lifespan.||",
