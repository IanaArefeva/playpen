Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of playing card games is 85%. The probability of not playing card games and long lifespan is 10%. The probability of playing card games and long lifespan is 42%. Is the chance of long lifespan larger when observing playing card games?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In fact, the direct relationship between card games and diabetes could imply that card games lead to a higher risk of diabetes, which in turn could lead to a lower chance of a long lifespan. The correct relationship between card games and long lifespan can be established by looking at the joint probability of card games and long lifespan, which is 42%, and the probability of not card games and long lifespan, which is 10%. The difference between these two probabilities is 32%, which is a measure of the positive association between card games and long lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
