Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 64%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 52%.

The only direct relationship we have is that diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Since we do not have any direct relationship between speaking English and diabetes, we need to consider the relationships through other variables. The probability of long lifespan is higher for those who do not speak English (64%) than for those who speak English (52%). This suggests that the direct effect of not speaking English on long lifespan is positive. If we consider the relationship through diabetes, we have a direct relationship between diabetes and lifespan, and a direct relationship between speaking English and diabetes. Since the direct relationship between speaking English and diabetes is not clear, we need to consider the joint relationship between speaking English and diabetes on long lifespan. The joint probability of not speaking English and having diabetes is not directly available, but we can conclude that the joint probability of speaking English and having diabetes is lower than the joint probability of not speaking English and having diabetes, since the probability of having diabetes is lower for those who speak English than for those who do not speak English. This joint relationship through diabetes on long lifespan is not clear, and we need to consider the joint relationship through both diabetes and the unobserved variable (smoking). The direct relationship between the unobserved variable (smoking) and long lifespan is not clear, and we need to consider the joint relationship through both diabetes and the unobserved variable (smoking) on long",
