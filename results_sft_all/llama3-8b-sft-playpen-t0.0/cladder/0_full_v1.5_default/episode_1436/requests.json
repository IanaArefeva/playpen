The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of clean water is 63%. For people with only polluted water, the probability of cholera contraction is 65%. For people with access to clean water, the probability of cholera contraction is 30%. Is cholera contraction less likely than cholera prevention overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that 63% of the time, people have clean water and a 30% chance of cholera, which is lower than the 65% chance of cholera for those with only polluted water. Since the overall probability of clean water is higher than the probability of only having polluted water, the overall probability of cholera contraction is lower than the probability of cholera prevention.<|eot_id|>",
