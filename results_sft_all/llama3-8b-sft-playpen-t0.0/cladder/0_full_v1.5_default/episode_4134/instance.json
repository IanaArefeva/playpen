  "input": "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and rainfall. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on rainfall. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of high rainfall is 52%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of high rainfall is 35%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 24%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 66%. Will increased supply decrease the chance of high rainfall?",
