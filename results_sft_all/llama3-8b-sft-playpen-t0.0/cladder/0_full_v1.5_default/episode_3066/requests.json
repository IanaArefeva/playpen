Vaccination has a direct effect on disease. We know that pre-conditions causes vaccine refusal. pre-conditions and getting the vaccine causes recovering from the disease.

In this world, the direct relationship between pre-conditions and disease is the only link that could lead to disease. Since the person has no pre-conditions, they are not at risk of contracting the disease through this path. The direct relationship between vaccination and disease is also not relevant here, as the person is not subject to the negative effect of pre-conditions. The person's ability to recover from the disease is entirely dependent on the direct positive effect of vaccination on disease, which is not present in the alternate scenario where the person refuses the vaccine.<|eot_id|>",
