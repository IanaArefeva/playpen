This means that if the patient has a large kidney stone, they will not receive any treatment. The direct relationship between treatment and recovery is that any treatment (not just specific treatments) leads to recovery. Since the patient has a large kidney stone and will not receive any treatment, we conclude that the patient will not recover.<|eot_id|>",
