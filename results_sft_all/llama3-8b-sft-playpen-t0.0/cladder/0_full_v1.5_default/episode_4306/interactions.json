The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 37%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 30%. For infants with smoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 84%. For infants with smoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of freckles is 55%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 77%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 100%. For infants with smoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 30%. For infants with smoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 64%. The overall probability of good health is 93%. Does maternal smoking status positively affect freckles through infant's birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between birth weight and freckles is also confirmed. The key piece of information that disconfirms the direct relationship between maternal smoking and freckles is the following: for infants with normal birth weight, the probability of freckles is higher when their mothers smoke than when their mothers do not smoke (55% vs. 30%). This pattern of higher freckle probability in the smoking group, specifically among those with normal birth weight, suggests that the positive relationship between maternal smoking and freckles is not direct but rather is being mediated by the birth weight of the infant.||",
