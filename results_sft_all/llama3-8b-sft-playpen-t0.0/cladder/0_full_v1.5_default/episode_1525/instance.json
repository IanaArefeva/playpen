Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 85%. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 50%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 51%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 17%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 17%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 32%. For managers who sign termination letters, would it be more likely to see employee being fired if the manager had signed the termination letter?",
