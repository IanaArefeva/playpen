The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 67%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 61%. For students who are encouraged, would it be less likely to see high exam score if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that encouragement acts as a negative confounder, decreasing the likelihood of a high exam score. If a student is encouraged, we would still see a lower probability of a high exam score compared to a student who is not encouraged. The studying habits of the students are not directly related to the encouragement level, so the studying habits do not play a role in this specific scenario. The direct relationship between encouragement and exam score is what matters here, and that relationship shows that encouragement leads to a lower probability of a high exam score.||",
