Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. We know that waking up late or heavy traffic causes arriving to school on time. We observed there is no traffic on the road. Would Alice arrives at school on time if waking up late instead of waking up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that there is no traffic on the road, the absence of this intervening variable does not change the outcome. The direct link between waking up late and being late remains unbroken, and the absence of any counteracting forces means that the late wake-up will still lead to a late arrival.<|eot_id|>",
