Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 51%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 45%. For individuals who are male, would it be less likely to see being lactose intolerant if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If we condition on being male, the additional information that the individual is not male does not change the probability of being lactose intolerant, which remains at 45%.<|eot_id|>",
