Talent has a direct effect on fame. For people who are famous, the correlation between attractive appearance and talent is -0.08. If we look at people who are famous, does it mean that attractive appearance does not affect talent?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between these two variables is being observed in a specific subpopulation (famous people), and the negative correlation could be due to various reasons such as confounding variables or reverse causality. In this world, we have direct effects of both appearance and talent on fame, and the negative correlation between appearance and talent among famous people does not preclude the possibility that attractive appearance still exerts an effect on talent.<|eot_id|>",
