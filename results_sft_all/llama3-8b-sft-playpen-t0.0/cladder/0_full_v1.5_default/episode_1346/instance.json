Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 37%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 83%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 30%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 78%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 14%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 44%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 61%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 87%. The overall probability of high pollution is 57%. Does gene negatively affect lung cancer through smoking?",
