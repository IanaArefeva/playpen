Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 8%. For patients who are not male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 22%. For patients who are male and do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 71%. For patients who are male and have a brother, the probability of recovery is 84%. The overall probability of male gender is 47%.
