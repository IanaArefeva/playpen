The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of high hospital bill is 51%. The probability of low hospital bill and recovery is 37%. The probability of high hospital bill and recovery is 17%. Is the chance of recovery larger when observing high hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship is between hospital costs and the probability of high hospital bill, which in turn affects the probability of recovery. The joint probability of high hospital bill and recovery is 17%, which is lower than the joint probability of low hospital bill and recovery (37%). This suggests that the chance of recovery is larger when observing a lower hospital bill, not a higher one.<|eot_id|>",
