The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and foot size. Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of large feet is 45%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of large feet is 22%. Will taking the elevator increase the chance of large feet?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of large feet is lower for those who take the elevator (22%) than for those who take the stairs (45%), and the intervening variable (penguin mood) is not directly affected by my decision, the increase in the probability of large feet is not a direct result of taking the elevator.||",
