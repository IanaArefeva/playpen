The probability of a high exam score for students who can swim is 73%, which is higher than the 13% probability for students who cannot swim. This positive direct relationship between ability to swim and exam score suggests that being able to swim will increase the chance of a high exam score, rather than decreasing it.<|eot_id|>",
