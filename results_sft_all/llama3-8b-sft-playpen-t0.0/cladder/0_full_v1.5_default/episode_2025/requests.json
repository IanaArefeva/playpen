Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between talent and being hard-working is -0.02. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does it mean that talent affects being hard-working?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between talent and being hard-working is not established in this world, and the negative correlation could be a result of other unexplored relationships or confounding variables.<|eot_id|>",
