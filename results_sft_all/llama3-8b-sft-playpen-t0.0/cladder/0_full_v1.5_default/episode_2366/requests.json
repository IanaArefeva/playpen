The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 55%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 41%. Does eating citrus negatively affect scurvy through vitmain C?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since citrus consumption directly affects vitmain C, and vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy, we can conclude that eating citrus has a positive effect on scurvy through this chain of cause and effect. The reduction in scurvy probability from 55% to 41% among citrus consumers is a direct result of the citrus consumption's positive effect on vitmain C, which in turn counteracts the negative effect of scurvy.<|eot_id|>",
