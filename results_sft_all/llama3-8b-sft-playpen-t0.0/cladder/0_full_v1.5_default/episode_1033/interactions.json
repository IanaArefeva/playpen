The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 59%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 48%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 48%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased supply is 92%. Will increased supply increase the chance of increased price?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
