Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 39%. The probability of vaccine refusal and being lactose intolerant is 45%. The probability of getting the vaccine and being lactose intolerant is 9%. Is the chance of being lactose intolerant larger when observing getting the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being lactose intolerant in the general population is 45% (P(LI)). The probability of being vaccinated is 39% (P(V)). To find the probability of being lactose intolerant and vaccinated, we need to consider the joint probability of both events, which is 9% (P(LI and V)). The target quantity we want to find is the probability of being lactose intolerant given that the person has been vaccinated, which is 9% (P(LI|V)). This is less than the general probability of being lactose intolerant (45%), so the chance of being lactose intolerant is not larger when observing getting the vaccine.<|eot_id|>",
