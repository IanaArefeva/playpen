Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 52%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 79%.

The key issue is whether the increase in lung cancer risk associated with jazz is a direct result of the jazz itself or an intervening variable (in this case, the tar deposit). The correct answer is \"No\" because the tar deposit acts as an intervening variable, and the direct relationship between jazz and lung cancer is through this intervening variable. The increase in lung cancer risk associated with jazz is not a direct result of the jazz but rather a result of the higher probability of tar deposit among those who listen to jazz, which in turn leads to a higher probability of lung cancer.<|eot_id|>",
