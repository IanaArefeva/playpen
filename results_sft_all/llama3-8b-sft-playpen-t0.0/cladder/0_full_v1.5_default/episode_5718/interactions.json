The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants who do not have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 46%. For infants who do not have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 71%. For infants who have a sister and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 18%. For infants who have a sister and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 46%. For infants who do not have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 59%. For infants who do not have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 19%. For infants who have a sister and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 83%. For infants who have a sister and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 44%. The overall probability of good health is 18%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would having a sister negatively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The table only provides the probability of high infant mortality for different subgroups of infants, which does not directly imply a negative effect of having a sister on infant's birth weight. In the subgroups where having a sister is present (with a sister and normal birth weight, and with a sister and poor health), the probability of high infant mortality is 46% and 46% respectively, which is lower than the 71% probability of high infant mortality in the subgroups without a sister and normal birth weight. This suggests that having a sister might reduce the risk of high infant mortality, rather than increase it.||",
