Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 56%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 24%. Will waking up late decrease the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that, in both scenarios, the probability of arriving on time is lower than the probability of not arriving on time (44% when she wakes up on time and 76% when she wakes up late). Since the probability of not arriving on time is higher when she wakes up late, it's not clear whether waking up late would decrease the chance of arriving to school on time.<|eot_id|>",
