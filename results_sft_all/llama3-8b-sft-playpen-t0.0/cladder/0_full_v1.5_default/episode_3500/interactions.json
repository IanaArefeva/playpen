The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: My decision has a direct effect on penguin mood and foot size. Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of large feet is 54%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of large feet is 49%. For those who choose to take the elevator, would it be less likely to see large feet if I had taken the stairs?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the penguin mood is not directly related to my decision, the probability of large feet among those who take the elevator is not directly affected by my decision to take the stairs. The difference in the probability of large feet between those who take the stairs and those who take the elevator is already accounted for by the different penguin moods associated with each transportation choice, rather than by my individual decision.||",
