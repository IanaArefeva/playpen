The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children who do not like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 37%. For children who do not like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 3%. For children who like spicy food and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 65%. For children who like spicy food and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 35%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 25%. For children who do not like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 29%. For children who like spicy food and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 59%. For children who like spicy food and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 66%. The overall probability of confounder active is 44%. Does liking spicy food positively affect child's intelligence through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence is not fully accounted for by the relationship between parents' social status and child's intelligence. The probability of intelligent child is higher for children who like spicy food and have high parental social status than for children who do not like spicy food and have high parental social status, which suggests that the positive effect of parents' social status on child's intelligence is not fully offset by the negative effect of not liking spicy food.<|eot_id|>",
