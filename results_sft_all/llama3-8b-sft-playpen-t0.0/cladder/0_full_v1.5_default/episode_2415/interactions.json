The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 99%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 77%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 26%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 9%. The overall probability of male gender is 47%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This suggests that the direct effect of male gender on recovery is positive, and that the direct effect of treatment on recovery is negative for male patients. Since the overall probability of male gender is 47%, we can conclude that the positive direct effect of male gender on recovery is strong enough to offset the negative direct effect of treatment on recovery, even for male patients who are not typically associated with higher recovery rates (i.e., those not receiving treatment).||",
