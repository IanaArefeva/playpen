The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. For people who do not speak english, the probability of the forest on fire is 86%. For people who speak english, the probability of the forest on fire is 72%.

The probability of the forest on fire is higher for those who do not speak English (86%) than for those who speak English (72%). This suggests that the ability to speak English might reduce the chance of the forest on fire, rather than increase it.<|eot_id|>",
