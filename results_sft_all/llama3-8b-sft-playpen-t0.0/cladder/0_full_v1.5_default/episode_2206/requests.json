The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Respiratory issues has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of respiratory issues is 93%. For people with no respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 81%. For people with respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 81%. Is broken bones less likely than no broken bones overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of respiratory issues is 93%, the number of people with no respiratory issues is a small fraction of the total population. In this scenario, the overall probability of broken bones is still 81%, which is higher than the probability of no broken bones (19%).<|eot_id|>",
