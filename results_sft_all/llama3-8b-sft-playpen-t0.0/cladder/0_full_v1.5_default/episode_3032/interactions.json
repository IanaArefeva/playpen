The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Age has a direct effect on hospital costs and recovery. Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. We know that old age causes low hospital bill. old age and high hospital bill causes recovery. We observed the patient is young. Would the patient doesn't recover if high hospital bill instead of low hospital bill?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
