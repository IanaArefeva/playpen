Hospital costs has a direct effect on recovery. We know that old age causes low hospital bill. old age and high hospital bill causes recovery. We observed the patient is young.

Since the patient is young, we can conclude that the hospital costs will be high, which in turn will lead to recovery. The condition of being young does not directly preclude the possibility of high hospital costs and subsequent recovery.<|eot_id|>",
