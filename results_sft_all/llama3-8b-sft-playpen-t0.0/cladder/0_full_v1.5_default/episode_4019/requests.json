The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 53%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 85%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 21%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 51%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 72%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 1%. Does smoking negatively affect lactose intolerance through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of smoking on lactose intolerance is not clear from the given information. The probability of being lactose intolerant for smokers and hard-working individuals is 51%, which is lower than the probability for nonsmokers and hard-working individuals (85%). This suggests that, in this specific context, being a smoker might reduce the likelihood of being lactose intolerant, but this reduction is not through the direct effect of smoking on lactose intolerance; rather, it is through the reduction in the likelihood of being hard-working among smokers.<|eot_id|>",
