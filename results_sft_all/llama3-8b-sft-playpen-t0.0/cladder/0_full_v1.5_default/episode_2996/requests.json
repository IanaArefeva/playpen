Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. We know that citrus intake causes vitamin C deficiency, and we know that sufficient vitamin C causes no scurvy.

Since citrus consumption is associated with lower vitamin C levels, and lower vitamin C levels lead to scurvy, citrus consumption would still lead to scurvy. The patient would not recover from scurvy if citrus intake instead of absence of citrus, as citrus consumption directly affects the body's ability to produce and store vitamin C, which is necessary for preventing scurvy.<|eot_id|>",
