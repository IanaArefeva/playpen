The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 56%. The probability of reduced supply and increased price is 32%. The probability of increased supply and increased price is 23%. Is the chance of increased price larger when observing increased supply?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between demand and price means that demand exerts a direct causal influence on price. The direct relationship between demand and price also means that demand exerts a direct causal influence on supply. The direct relationship between demand and supply further means that demand exerts a direct causal influence on price through the intermediate variable of supply. The direct relationship between demand and price, and the direct relationship between demand and supply, imply that demand exerts a direct and indirect causal influence on price. The direct and indirect causal influence of demand on price means that the probability of an increase in price is not entirely dependent on the direct relationship between supply and price. The direct and indirect causal influence of demand on price also means that the probability of an increase in price is not entirely dependent on the direct relationship between yield per acre and price.
