Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved.

Since the person is a nonsmoker, the only remaining cause of having diabetes is being obese. If the person is obese, then they will have diabetes, and since having diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan, the person will have a long lifespan. The condition of being a nonsmoker does not imply a short lifespan; rather, it rules out the possibility of the person being a smoker, which is the only other cause of having diabetes.<|eot_id|>",
