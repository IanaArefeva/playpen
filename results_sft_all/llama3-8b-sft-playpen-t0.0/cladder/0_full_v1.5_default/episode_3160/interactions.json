The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 8%. For people who do not drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 51%. For people who drink coffee and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 49%. For people who drink coffee and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 92%. For people who do not drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 85%. For people who drink coffee, the probability of alarm set by wife is 60%. If we disregard the mediation effect through wife, would drinking coffee negatively affect alarm clock?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
