The direct effect of medication on heart condition is that it causes a healthy heart, but this is only when medication is taken in the absence of high blood pressure. If medication is taken and it leads to high blood pressure, then the person's heart condition would be negative. Since we know that taking medication causes high blood pressure, and high blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition, we can conclude that the person's heart condition would be negative if they take medication.<|eot_id|>",
