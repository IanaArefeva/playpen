The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 43%. For people considered unattractive and are not famous, the probability of talent is 4%. For people considered unattractive and are famous, the probability of talent is 27%. For people considered attractive and are not famous, the probability of talent is 4%. For people considered attractive and are famous, the probability of talent is 11%. If we look at people who are famous, does the chance of talent decrease when attractive appearance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The difference between these two probabilities is 16%, which is not a decrease. In fact, the probability of talent among famous people is higher when they are attractive than when they are unattractive.<|eot_id|>",
