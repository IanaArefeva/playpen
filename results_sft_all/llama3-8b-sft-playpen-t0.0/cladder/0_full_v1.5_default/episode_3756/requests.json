Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between listening to jazz and being hard-working is -0.16.

The relationship between these two variables is likely spurious, as both are associated with the same underlying cause (elite institution admission), rather than being causally connected. The negative sign of the correlation might be due to the specific characteristics of the subpopulation being considered (students already accepted to elite institutions), rather than any direct causal link between jazz and being hard-working.<|eot_id|>",
