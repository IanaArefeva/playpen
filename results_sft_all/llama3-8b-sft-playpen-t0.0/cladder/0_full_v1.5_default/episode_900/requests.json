The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 15%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 53%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 30%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 72%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 42%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 70%. Does smoking positively affect college admission through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of college admission for smokers and hard-working students is 72%, which is higher than the probability of college admission for nonsmokers and hard-working students (53%). This suggests that there might be an additional direct effect of smoking on college admission that is not fully captured by the intervening variable of effort.<|eot_id|>",
