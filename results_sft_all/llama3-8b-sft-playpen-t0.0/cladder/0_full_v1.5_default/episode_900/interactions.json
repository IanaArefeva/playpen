The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 15%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 53%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 30%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 72%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 42%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 70%. Does smoking positively affect college admission through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of college admission for smokers and hard-working students is 72%, which is higher than the probability of college admission for nonsmokers and hard-working students (53%). This suggests that there might be an additional direct effect of smoking on college admission that is not fully captured by the intervening variable of effort.||",
