Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 54%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 26%.

For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of intelligent child is 51%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 37%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 46%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 76%.
