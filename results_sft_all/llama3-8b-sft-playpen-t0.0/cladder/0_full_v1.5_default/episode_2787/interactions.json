The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. For people served by a local water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 54%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of cholera contraction is 41%. For people served by a local water company, the probability of clean water is 56%. For people served by a global water company, the probability of clean water is 26%. Will clean water increase the chance of cholera contraction?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Additionally, the water company has a direct effect on water quality, which further solidifies the link between water quality and cholera. The probability of clean water is higher for people served by a local water company (56%) than for those served by a global water company (26%). This difference in water quality directly affects the probability of cholera contraction, which is lower for people served by a local water company (54%) than for those served by a global water company (41%). This pattern of higher water quality corresponding to lower cholera risk and lower water quality corresponding to higher cholera risk suggests that clean water does not increase the chance of cholera contraction; rather, it appears to reduce the risk of cholera.||",
