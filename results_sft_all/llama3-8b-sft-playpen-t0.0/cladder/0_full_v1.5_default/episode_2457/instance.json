For patients who are young and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 74%. For patients who are old and pay a low hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 23%. For patients who are old and pay a high hospital bill, the probability of recovery is 2%. The overall probability of old age is 46%. For people who pay a high hospital bill, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient had paid a low hospital bill?",
