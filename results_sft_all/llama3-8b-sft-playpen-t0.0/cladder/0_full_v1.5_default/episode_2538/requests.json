The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 60%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 86%. For infants with smoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 36%. For infants with smoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 61%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 43%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 14%. For infants with smoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 71%. For infants with smoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 49%. The overall probability of good health is 15%. Does maternal smoking status negatively affect infant mortality through infant's birth weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between maternal smoking status and infant's birth weight is not fully specified in the given conditions. The probability of normal birth weight for different health conditions and maternal smoking status is as follows: for nonsmoking mothers and good health, the probability is 14%; for nonsmoking mothers and poor health, the probability is 43%; for smoking mothers and good health, the probability is 49%; and for smoking mothers and poor health, the probability is 71%.
