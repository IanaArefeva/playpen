The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 36%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 74%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 46%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 69%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 78%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 21%. Does smoking negatively affect lactose intolerance through effort?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between smoking and lactose intolerance is not clear from the given information. The probability of being lactose intolerant is higher for both smokers and nonsmokers who are hard-working than for those who are lazy. This suggests that the relationship between smoking and lactose intolerance is more closely associated with the intervening variable \"effort\" than with a direct causal link.||",
