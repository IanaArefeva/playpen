Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 33%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 17%. Will citrus intake decrease the chance of scurvy?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this world, citrus consumption does not directly reduce the chance of scurvy; rather, it directly affects the probability of scurvy by decreasing it from 33% to 17%. The reduction in scurvy probability is a result of citrus consumption, not a cause of it.<|eot_id|>",
