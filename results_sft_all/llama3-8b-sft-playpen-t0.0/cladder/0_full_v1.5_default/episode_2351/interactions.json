The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 33%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 17%. Will citrus intake decrease the chance of scurvy?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
