The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on rainfall. Sprinkler has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of rainy season is 93%. For people in the dry season, the probability of high rainfall is 62%. For in the rainy season, the probability of high rainfall is 69%. Is high rainfall more likely than low rainfall overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of the rainy season is 93%, we can conclude that the overall probability of high rainfall is higher than the probability of the dry season, which is 7%. The probability of high rainfall in the rainy season is higher than the probability of the dry season, and the probability of the rainy season is higher than the probability of the dry season. This means that the overall probability of high rainfall is higher than the probability of the dry season, which is 7%.<|eot_id|>",
