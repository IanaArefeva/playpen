The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. We know that male gender or in-state residency causes competitive department. male gender and in-state residency and competitive department causes admission acceptance. We observed the resident is in-state. Would the applicant gets rejected if male gender instead of non-male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that the applicant is in-state, the direct effect of in-state residency on competitive department is already accounted for. The male gender of the applicant still exerts its separate direct effect on competitive department, which in turn exerts its direct effect on admission status. Since male gender and in-state residency both lead to a competitive department, and a competitive department leads to admission acceptance, the male gender of the applicant still leads to admission acceptance, and the applicant would not get rejected.<|eot_id|>",
