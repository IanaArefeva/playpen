The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of high rainfall is 52%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of high rainfall is 85%. Will waking up late decrease the chance of high rainfall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of high rainfall is also directly affected by the state of the weather, which is not directly related to Alice's wake-up time. In this world, the state of the weather is the primary driver of the probability of high rainfall, and the direct relationship between Alice's wake-up time and the probability of high rainfall is a separate, distinct relationship. If we control for the state of the weather, we can see that the probability of high rainfall is higher when Alice wakes up late than when she wakes up on time. This suggests that, in the absence of any other intervening variables, waking up late would not decrease the chance of high rainfall.<|eot_id|>",
