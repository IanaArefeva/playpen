The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and lactose intolerance. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 63%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 95%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 37%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 67%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 94%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 48%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender negatively affect lactose intolerance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of being lactose intolerant is higher for women than for men in both the competitive and non-competitive scenarios. In the competitive scenario, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 95% for women and 67% for men. In the non-competitive scenario, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 63% for women and 37% for men. This positive relationship between gender and lactose intolerance suggests that, in this world, being a woman is associated with a higher likelihood of being lactose intolerant, rather than a lower likelihood.||",
