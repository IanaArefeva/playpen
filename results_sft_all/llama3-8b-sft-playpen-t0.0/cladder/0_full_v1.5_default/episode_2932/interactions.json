The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active and close to a college causes college degree or higher. confounder active and college degree or higher causes high salary. We observed the person lives close to a college and confounder inactive. Would the employee has a low salary if high school degree or lower instead of college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we know that living close to a college directly affects education level and that the person is close to a college, we can conclude that their education level is college degree or higher. Additionally, we are given that the person's unobserved confounder is inactive, which means that the direct effect of the confounder on education level is neutralized. In this case, the person's college degree or higher education level directly affects their high salary. If the person's education level were high school degree or lower, we would need to consider the direct effect of the unobserved confounder on education level, which is not neutralized in this case. Since we do not have any additional information about the direct effect of the unobserved confounder on education level when the person is close to a college, we cannot conclude that the person's salary would be lower if their education level were high school degree or lower.||",
