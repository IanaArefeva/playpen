Since we know that living close to a college directly affects education level and that the person is close to a college, we can conclude that their education level is college degree or higher. Additionally, we are given that the person's unobserved confounder is inactive, which means that the direct effect of the confounder on education level is neutralized. In this case, the person's college degree or higher education level directly affects their high salary. If the person's education level were high school degree or lower, we would need to consider the direct effect of the unobserved confounder on education level, which is not neutralized in this case. Since we do not have any additional information about the direct effect of the unobserved confounder on education level when the person is close to a college, we cannot conclude that the person's salary would be lower if their education level were high school degree or lower.<|eot_id|>",
