The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and peanut allergy. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on peanut allergy. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 42%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 55%. For smokers, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 64%. Is being allergic to peanuts less likely than not being allergic to peanuts overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 64% for smokers and 55% for nonsmokers, and the overall probability of smoking is 42%, we can conclude that the higher probability of being allergic to peanuts among smokers than among nonsmokers more than counterbalances the lower probability of being a smoker, leading to a higher overall probability of being allergic to peanuts than not being allergic to peanuts.||",
