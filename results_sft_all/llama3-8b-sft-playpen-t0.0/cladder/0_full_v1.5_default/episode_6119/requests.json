The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Liking spicy food has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that liking spicy food and confounder active causes high parental social status. liking spicy food or confounder active or high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder active. Would the child is intelligent if liking spicy food instead of not liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since we already know that the child is intelligent, we can conclude that the direct effect of the unobserved confounder on child's intelligence must be positive. If we were to like spicy food instead of not liking it, the direct positive effect of the unobserved confounder on child's intelligence would still be present, and the direct negative effect of not liking spicy food on child's intelligence would be absent. This would lead to a net positive effect on child's intelligence, and the child would still be intelligent.<|eot_id|>",
