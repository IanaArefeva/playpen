The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 42%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 88%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 45%. Is arriving to school on time less likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of Alice waking up on time is 1 - 0.42 = 0.58. The probability of Alice waking up on time and then arriving on time is 0.58 * 0.88 = 0.51. The probability of Alice waking up late and still arriving on time is 0.42 * 0.45 = 0.19. The total probability of Alice arriving to school on time is 0.51 + 0.19 = 0.70. The probability of Alice arriving to school late is 1 - 0.70 = 0.30. Since 0.70 is greater than 0.30, it is more likely for Alice to arrive to school on time than late.<|eot_id|>",
