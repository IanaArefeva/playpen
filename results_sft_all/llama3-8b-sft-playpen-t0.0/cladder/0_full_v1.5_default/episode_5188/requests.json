Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of brown eyes is 50%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of brown eyes is 39%. For students who are encouraged, would it be more likely to see brown eyes if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between studying habits and brown eyes is that studying habits lead to a higher probability of brown eyes. Since encouragement and studying habits are separate causes of brown eyes, we need to consider their joint effect. If a student is encouraged, they are more likely to have a studying habits that lead to brown eyes. In this case, the joint effect of encouragement and studying habits on brown eyes is more likely to lead to brown eyes than the separate effect of encouragement.<|eot_id|>",
