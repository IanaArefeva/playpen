Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 15%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 55%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 13%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer given smoking is not directly provided, but we can infer it from the given information. The probability of lung cancer given smoking is the same as the probability of lung cancer given that the person has both smoked and has a high level of tar deposit. The probability of having a high level of tar deposit given that the person has smoked is 1 (since all smokers will have a high level of tar deposit), and the probability of having a high level of tar deposit given that the person has lung cancer is also 1 (since all people with lung cancer will have a high level of tar deposit). The probability of lung cancer given that the person has both smoked and has a high level of tar deposit is the same as the probability of lung cancer given that the person has a high level of tar deposit, which is the same as the probability of lung cancer given that the person is a nonsmoker (since the only difference between the two groups is the level of tar deposit, and the probability of lung cancer is the same for both groups). The probability of lung cancer given that the person is a nonsmoker is 55%, and the probability of lung cancer given that the person has smoked is the same as the probability of lung cancer given that the person has both smoked and has a high level of tar deposit, which is also 55%.<|eot_id|>",
