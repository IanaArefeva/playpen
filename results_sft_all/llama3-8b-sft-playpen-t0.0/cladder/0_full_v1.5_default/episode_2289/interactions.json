The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. The overall probability of smoking is 89%. The probability of nonsmoking and college admission is 3%. The probability of smoking and college admission is 55%. Is the chance of college admission smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between smoking and college admission supersedes the direct relationship between college admission and effort, which is also positive. The higher probability of college admission when smoking (55%) compared to the probability of college admission when not smoking (3%) indicates that the positive direct relationship between smoking and college admission is more influential than the positive direct relationship between college admission and effort.||",
