The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on full moon and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on full moon. Full moon has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 59%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of increased price is 40%. For farms with reduced crop yield per acre, the probability of full moon is 60%. For farms with increased crop yield per acre, the probability of full moon is 8%. Will full moon increase the chance of increased price?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of full moon is higher for farms with reduced yield per acre (60%) than for those with increased yield per acre (8%). This difference in probability of full moon between the two groups of farm yield per acre directly affects the probability of price increase. Since the probability of full moon is higher for the group with lower yield per acre, this group is more likely to have a higher demand, which in turn directly affects the price. This chain of cause and effect—reduced yield per acre leading to higher demand, which then leads to a higher probability of full moon and finally a higher probability of price increase—ensures that full moon will increase the chance of an increased price.||",
