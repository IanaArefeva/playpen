The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and lip thickness. Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 4%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 35%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 61%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 92%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 47%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see thick lips if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The treatment also has a direct effect on thick lips, and this effect is not uniform across all groups. In particular, for patients with large kidney stones, the probability of thick lips is higher when they are not receiving treatment (61%) than when they are (92%). This suggests that the treatment is not only counteracting the direct effect of kidney stone size on thick lips, but also has a separate, positive effect on thick lips that is more pronounced in the large kidney stone group. In the absence of any unmentioned factors or causal relationships, we must conclude that the probability of thick lips is higher for patients with large kidney stones who are not receiving treatment than for those who are.<|eot_id|>",
