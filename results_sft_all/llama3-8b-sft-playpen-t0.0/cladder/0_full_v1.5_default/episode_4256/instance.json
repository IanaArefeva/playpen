Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 4%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 35%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 61%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 92%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 47%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see thick lips if the patient had received no treatment?",
