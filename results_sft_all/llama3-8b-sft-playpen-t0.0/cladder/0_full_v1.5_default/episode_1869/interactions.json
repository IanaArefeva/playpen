The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. The overall probability of taking medication is 19%. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 64%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 31%. Is healthy heart more likely than heart problems overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a person having a heart condition is 1 - 0.64 = 0.36 for those not taking medication and 1 - 0.31 = 0.69 for those taking medication. The overall probability of a person having a heart condition is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is (0.19 * 0.69) + (0.81 * 0.36) = 0.46. Since this is less than 0.5, a heart condition is less likely than a healthy heart overall.||",
