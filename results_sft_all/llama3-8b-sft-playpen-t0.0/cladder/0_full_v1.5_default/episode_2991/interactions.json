The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. We know that obesity or smoker causes having diabetes. obesity or smoker or having diabetes causes long lifespan. We observed the person is a nonsmoker. Would the person has a short lifespan if obesity instead of normal weight?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we also know that obesity or smoker or having diabetes causes long lifespan, and the person is a nonsmoker, we can conclude that the person does not have diabetes. If the person does not have diabetes, then the only remaining possibility is that the person is of normal weight. Since we are asked whether the person would have a short lifespan if they instead of normal weight, we can conclude that the person would not have a short lifespan in that scenario, as the person is already of normal weight and does not have diabetes.||",
