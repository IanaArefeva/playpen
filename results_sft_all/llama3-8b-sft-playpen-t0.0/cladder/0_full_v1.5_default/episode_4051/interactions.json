The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 77%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 45%. For people who speak english, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The only direct relationships established are between language ability and diabetes, and between diabetes and long lifespan. The probability of long lifespan is higher for those who do not speak English (77%) than for those who do speak English (45%). This suggests that not speaking English might be associated with a higher likelihood of long lifespan, rather than a lower one.||",
