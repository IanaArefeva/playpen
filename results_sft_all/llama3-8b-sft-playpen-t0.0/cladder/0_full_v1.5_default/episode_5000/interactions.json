The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people who do not have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 61%. For people who do not have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 92%. For people who have a sister and with low blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 18%. For people who have a sister and with high blood pressure, the probability of healthy heart is 45%. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 61%. For people who have a sister, the probability of high blood pressure is 14%. Does having a sister positively affect heart condition through blood pressure?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a healthy heart among those with a sister and high blood pressure (45%) is lower than among those without a sister and with high blood pressure (92%). This suggests that having a sister exerts an independent effect on heart condition that is not fully accounted for by blood pressure.||",
