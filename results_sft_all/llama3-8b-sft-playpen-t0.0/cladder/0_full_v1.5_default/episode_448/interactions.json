The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Medication has a direct effect on blood pressure and heart condition. Blood pressure has a direct effect on heart condition. For people not taking any medication, the probability of healthy heart is 38%. For people taking medication, the probability of healthy heart is 61%. For people taking medication, would it be less likely to see healthy heart if the person had taken no medication?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of blood pressure on heart condition is also positive, meaning that higher blood pressure is associated with a lower probability of a healthy heart. Since medication has a direct positive effect on heart condition, and blood pressure has a direct negative effect on heart condition, the relationship between medication and heart condition is not fully mediated by blood pressure. In other words, medication still directly affects heart condition, even after controlling for blood pressure. This means that, for people taking medication, the probability of a healthy heart is higher than for those not taking medication, and this difference is not fully explained by differences in blood pressure.||",
