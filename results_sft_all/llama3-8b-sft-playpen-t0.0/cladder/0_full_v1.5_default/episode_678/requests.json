Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 32%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 76%. For students who are encouraged, would it be more likely to see high exam score if the student had received no encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This indicates that encouragement has a positive effect on exam score. If a student who is encouraged still does not have a high exam score, it would imply that the student's exam score is not fully determined by the encouragement they received. In such a case, the exam score would be more likely to be high if the student had not been encouraged, since the absence of encouragement would not reduce the exam score below the base level of 32%.<|eot_id|>",
