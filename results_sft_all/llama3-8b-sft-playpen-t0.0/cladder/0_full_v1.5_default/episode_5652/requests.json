The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who have small kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 88%. For patients who have small kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 79%. For patients who have large kidney stones and do not speak english, the probability of recovery is 23%. For patients who have large kidney stones and speak english, the probability of recovery is 10%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 45%. For patients who speak english, would it be more likely to see recovery if the patient did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The ability to speak English also has a direct effect on recovery, and this effect is not uniform across all groups. For patients with small kidney stones, the probability of recovery is higher when they speak English (79%) than when they do not (88%). This suggests that the ability to speak English may actually counteract the positive effect of having a small kidney stone on recovery. In the case of large kidney stones, the probability of recovery is lower when patients speak English (10%) than when they do not (23%). This further supports the idea that the ability to speak English may have a negative effect on recovery when kidney stone size is large. Since the overall probability of large kidney stone is 45%, we need to consider the joint distribution of kidney stone size and language ability. If we condition on the event that the patient has a large kidney stone, we see that the probability of recovery is lower when the patient speaks English (10%) than when they do not (23%). This suggests that, for patients with large kidney stones, not speaking English is associated with higher recovery rates.<|eot_id|>",
