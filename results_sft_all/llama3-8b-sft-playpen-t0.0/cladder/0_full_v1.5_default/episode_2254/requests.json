The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 11%. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 71%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 41%. Is intelligent child more likely than unintelligent child overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of an intelligent child with intelligent parents is 0.11 * 0.41 = 0.0449. The probability of an intelligent child with unintelligent parents is 0.89 * 0.71 = 0.6299. The total probability of an intelligent child is 0.0449 + 0.6299 = 0.6748. The probability of an unintelligent child is 1 - 0.6748 = 0.3252. Since 0.6748 > 0.3252, an intelligent child is more likely than an unintelligent child.<|eot_id|>",
