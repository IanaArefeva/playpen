The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 82%. The probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 13%. The probability of obesity and long lifespan is 51%. Is the chance of long lifespan smaller when observing obesity?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of obesity is 82%, and the probability of normal weight and long lifespan is 13%, we can conclude that the positive direct effect of obesity on lifespan must be strong enough to counteract the negative direct effect of diabetes on lifespan. This is confirmed by the fact that the probability of obesity and long lifespan is 51%, which is higher than the probability of normal weight and long lifespan (13%). Therefore, the chance of long lifespan is not smaller when observing obesity.||",
