The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 32%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 14%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of lung cancer is already lower for smokers (14%) than for nonsmokers (32%), and this lower probability is a direct result of the lower tar deposit associated with smoking, it is not necessary for a smoker to have been a nonsmoker in order to have a lower probability of lung cancer. The lower probability of lung cancer among smokers is already accounted for by their lower tar deposit, which directly affects the risk of lung cancer.||",
