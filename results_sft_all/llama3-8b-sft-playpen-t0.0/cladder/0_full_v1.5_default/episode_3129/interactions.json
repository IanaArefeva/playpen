The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. We know that high poverty and global water company causes clean water. high poverty and clean water causes cholera contraction. We observed the person is served by a global water company and the region has low poverty. Would the person gets cholera if clean water instead of polluted water?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since we have a direct link from water quality to cholera, and we already established that the person is served by a global water company (causing clean water), we can conclude that the person is likely to have clean water. Additionally, we have a direct link from clean water to cholera contraction, but this link is only active when there is also high poverty. Since we already established that the person is in a region with low poverty, this link is not active for this person. Therefore, we can conclude that the person is not likely to get cholera, even if they have clean water.||",
