The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of high rainfall is 52%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of high rainfall is 84%. Will waking up late increase the chance of high rainfall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The additional condition that \"Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall\" must also be considered. In this world, the probability of high rainfall is not only determined by Alice's wake-up time but also by the state of the traffic. If the traffic condition is bad, the probability of high rainfall might still be high, even if Alice wakes up on time. In other words, the direct relationship between Alice's wake-up time and the probability of high rainfall is not a complete cause, and the additional condition of bad traffic could still lead to a high probability of rain, even if Alice wakes up on time.<|eot_id|>",
