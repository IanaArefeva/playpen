The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 48%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 36%. For individuals who are male, would it be less likely to see admission acceptance if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that being male directly decreases the likelihood of admission acceptance. If we condition on being male, the subsequent effect of being male on the probability of admission acceptance is still a reduction from 36% to a lower value, which we can denote as p. Since the direct effect of being male on the probability of admission acceptance is a reduction, and this reduction is already accounted for in the base probability of 36%, the subsequent effect of being male on the probability of admission acceptance is still a reduction, and the probability of admission acceptance remains lower than 36%.||",
