The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 88%. The probability of not drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 3%. The probability of drinking coffee and ringing alarm is 63%. Is the chance of ringing alarm larger when observing drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of not drinking coffee and not ringing alarm is 9% (12% - 3%). The probability of not drinking coffee and not ringing alarm is larger than the probability of not drinking coffee and ringing alarm, which means that the chance of ringing alarm is larger when not observing drinking coffee.<|eot_id|>",
