The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on having a brother and recovery. Having a brother has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of having a brother is 46%. For patients who do not have a brother, the probability of recovery is 62%. For patients who have a brother, the probability of recovery is 34%. Is recovery more likely than non-recovery overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the direct effects of both being male and having a brother on recovery are negative, and the overall probability of having a brother is higher than that of being male (46% vs 50%), we can conclude that the negative direct effect of having a brother on recovery is more influential than the positive direct effect of being male on having a brother. This leads to a lower overall probability of recovery than non-recovery.<|eot_id|>",
