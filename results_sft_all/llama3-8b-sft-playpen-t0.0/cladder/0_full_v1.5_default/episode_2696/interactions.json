The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. The overall probability of smoking is 16%. The probability of nonsmoking and lung cancer is 54%. The probability of smoking and lung cancer is 13%. Is the chance of lung cancer larger when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of lung cancer given smoking is not directly available, but we can use the law of total probability to find it. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event E is the sum of the probabilities of E given each cause C times the probability of C. In this case, the event E is lung cancer, and the cause C is smoking. The law of total probability can be represented as: P(E) = P(E|C)P(C) + P(E|not C)P(not C). In our case, E is lung cancer, C is smoking, and not C is nonsmoking. The probability of E (lung cancer) is 0.54, the probability of C (smoking) is 0.16, and the probability of not C (nonsmoking) is 0.84. The probability of E given C (P(E|C) = P(lung cancer|smoking) is the target we want to find. The law of total probability can be represented as: 0.54 = P(E|C)P(C) + 0.54P(not C). Solving for P(E|C), we get: P(E|C) = (0.54 - 0.54P(not C)) / P(C) = (0.54 - 0.54*0",
