Skill has a direct effect on occupation and salary. Occupation has a direct effect on salary. Skill is unobserved. We know that male gender and high skill level causes white-collar job. male gender and high skill level and white-collar job causes high salary. We observed the person has a low skill level. Would the employee has a low salary if non-male gender instead of male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This suggests that male gender has an additional direct effect on white-collar job beyond its joint effect with skill. Since male gender is associated with white-collar job, and white-collar job is associated with high salary, we can conclude that male gender is also associated with high salary. The person's non-male gender would likely lead to a lower salary, as it would reduce the likelihood of white-collar job and, by extension, high salary.<|eot_id|>",
