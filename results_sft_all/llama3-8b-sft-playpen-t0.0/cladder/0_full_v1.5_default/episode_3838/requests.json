The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and peanut allergy. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. The overall probability of male gender is 41%. The probability of non-male gender and being allergic to peanuts is 17%. The probability of male gender and being allergic to peanuts is 20%. Is the chance of being allergic to peanuts smaller when observing male gender?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The interaction between male gender and department competitiveness also needs to be considered. Since male gender has a direct positive effect on department competitiveness, and this, in turn, has a direct positive effect on the probability of being allergic to peanuts, we must carefully examine the joint probability of male gender and being allergic to peanuts. The given probability of male gender and being allergic to peanuts is 20%, which is higher than the probability of being allergic to peanuts in general (17%). This suggests that male gender might actually increase the likelihood of being allergic to peanuts, rather than reduce it.<|eot_id|>",
