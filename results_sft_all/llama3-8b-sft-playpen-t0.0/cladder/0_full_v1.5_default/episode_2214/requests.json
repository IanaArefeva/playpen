Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of respiratory issues is 57%. For people with no respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 98%. For people with respiratory issues, the probability of broken bones is 98%. Is broken bones less likely than no broken bones overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of respiratory issues is 57%, the overall probability of broken bones can be calculated as follows: (1 - 0.57) * 0.98 + 0.57 * 0.98 = 0.98. This means that the probability of broken bones is still 98% overall, which is higher than the probability of no broken bones (1 - 0.98 = 0.02).<|eot_id|>",
