Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 56%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 9%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 9%. Is talent more likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being unattractive is 44% (100% - 56%) and the probability of being attractive is 56%, the overall probability of having talent is a weighted average of the two groups, which is (0.44 * 0.09) + (0.56 * 0.09) = 0.0484. The probability of lacking talent is 1 - 0.0484 = 0.9516, which is higher than the probability of having talent.<|eot_id|>",
