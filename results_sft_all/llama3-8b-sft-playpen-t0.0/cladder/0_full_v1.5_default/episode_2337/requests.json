Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 53%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 74%. Will obesity decrease the chance of long lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is also positive, which further supports the idea that obesity, through its positive effect on long lifespan, does not decrease the chance of long lifespan.<|eot_id|>",
