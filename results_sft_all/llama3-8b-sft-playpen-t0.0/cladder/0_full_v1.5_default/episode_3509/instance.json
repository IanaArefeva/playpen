Penguin mood has a direct effect on foot size. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are sad, the probability of large feet is 6%. For those who choose to take the stairs and penguins who are happy, the probability of large feet is 60%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are sad, the probability of large feet is 23%. For those who choose to take the elevator and penguins who are happy, the probability of large feet is 77%. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of penguin happiness is 68%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of penguin happiness is 50%. If we disregard the mediation effect through penguin mood, would my decision positively affect foot size?",
