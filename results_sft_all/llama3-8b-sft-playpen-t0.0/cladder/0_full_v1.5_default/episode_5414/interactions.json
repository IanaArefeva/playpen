The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and freckles. Effort has a direct effect on freckles. The overall probability of smoking is 94%. The probability of nonsmoking and freckles is 5%. The probability of smoking and freckles is 54%. Is the chance of freckles smaller when observing smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The relationship between effort and freckles is also direct and positive, meaning that higher effort leads to higher probability of freckles. Since the probability of smoking is 94%, most of the time, we will see someone who is smoking. In those cases, the direct positive relationship between smoking and freckles will likely lead to a higher probability of freckles. The direct positive relationship between effort and freckles will further increase this probability. In the 5% of the time when we see someone who is not smoking, the direct positive relationship between effort and freckles will still lead to a higher probability of freckles than if we were seeing someone who is smoking. This is because the 5% of the time when we see someone who is not smoking is likely to be when that person is putting in more effort, which directly leads to a higher probability of freckles.||",
