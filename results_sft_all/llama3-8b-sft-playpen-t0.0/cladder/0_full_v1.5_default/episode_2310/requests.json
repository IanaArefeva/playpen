Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 90%. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 81%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 70%.

The direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan is not directly quantified, but since we are not given any direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan, we can conclude that the direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan is not quantified. The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is that the probability of long lifespan is lower for people with diabetes than for those without (not quantified). The direct relationship between obesity and diabetes is that the probability of diabetes is higher for obese people than for normal weight people (not quantified). The direct relationship between smoking and diabetes is that the probability of diabetes is higher for people who smoke than for those who do not (not quantified). The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is that the probability of long lifespan is lower for people with diabetes than for those without (not quantified). The direct relationship between obesity and long lifespan is that the probability of long lifespan is lower for obese people than for normal weight people (70% vs. 81%). The direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan is not quantified. The direct relationship between diabetes and long lifespan is that the probability of long lifespan is lower for people with diabetes than for those without (not quantified).
