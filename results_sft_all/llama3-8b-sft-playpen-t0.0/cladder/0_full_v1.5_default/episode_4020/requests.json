Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of smoking is 9%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 76%. For smokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 22%. Is being lactose intolerant more likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being a smoker is 9%, the overall probability of being lactose intolerant is (9% * 22%) + (91% * 76%) = 1.98% + 70.26% = 72.24%. This is higher than 50%, so being lactose intolerant is more likely than not being lactose intolerant overall.<|eot_id|>",
