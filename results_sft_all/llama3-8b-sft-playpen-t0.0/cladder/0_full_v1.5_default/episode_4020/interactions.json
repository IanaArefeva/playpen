The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of smoking is 9%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 76%. For smokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 22%. Is being lactose intolerant more likely than not being lactose intolerant overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
