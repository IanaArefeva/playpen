The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of solar eclipse is 65%. The probability of no solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 23%. The probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 24%. Is the chance of arriving to school on time smaller when observing solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 24%. The direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is positive, meaning that solar eclipse is associated with a higher probability of Alice's arrival. The direct effect of no solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is also positive, meaning that no solar eclipse is associated with a higher probability of Alice's arrival. The direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not negative, and the direct effect of no solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not negative. The probability of no solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is lower than the probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time, which means that the direct effect of no solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not as strong as the direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival. The direct effect of solar eclipse on Alice's arrival is not as strong as the direct effect of no solar eclipse on Alice's arrival, which means that the chance of arriving to school on time is not smaller when observing solar eclipse.<|eot_id|>",
