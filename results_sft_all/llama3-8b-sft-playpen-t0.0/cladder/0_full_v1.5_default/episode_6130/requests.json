If the person is not lactose intolerant, then they must not be hard-working, and since they smoke, this would imply that the direct relationship between smoking and being hard-working is not active in this case. This would lead to a conflict with the direct relationship between being hard-working and being lactose intolerant, which would imply that the person should be lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
