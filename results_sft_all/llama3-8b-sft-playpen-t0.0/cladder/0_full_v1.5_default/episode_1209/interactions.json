The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 62%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 31%. For infants with smoking mothers and low infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 96%. For infants with smoking mothers and normal infant birth weight, the probability of high infant mortality is 60%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 81%. For infants with nonsmoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 76%. For infants with smoking mothers and with poor health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 33%. For infants with smoking mothers and with good health, the probability of normal infant birth weight is 42%. The overall probability of good health is 45%. If we disregard the mediation effect through infant's birth weight, would maternal smoking status positively affect infant mortality?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of high infant mortality is higher for infants with smoking mothers than for those with nonsmoking mothers in both the \"low birth weight\" and \"normal birth weight\" groups. In particular, the probability of high infant mortality is 96% for infants with smoking mothers and low birth weight, compared to 62% for those with nonsmoking mothers and low birth weight. This suggests that maternal smoking status has a positive direct effect on the risk of high infant mortality, but this positive direct effect is overwhelmed by the negative direct effect of health condition on the risk of high infant mortality, which is not accounted for in the direct effect of birth weight on the risk of high infant mortality.||",
