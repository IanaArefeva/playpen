The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 71%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 24%. For days when Alice wakes up late, would it be less likely to see arriving to school on time if Alice had gotten up on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the direct effect of Alice's wake-up time on her arrival time is strong, and the direct effect of the time of day on her arrival time is also strong. The interaction between these two direct effects is not specified in the given conditions, so we must conclude that the probability of Alice arriving to school on time is not directly related to the interaction between her wake-up time and the time of day.||",
