The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 23%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 58%. For infants with smoking mothers, would it be less likely to see high infant mortality if the infant had a nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The health condition is unobserved, so we can't directly account for its influence. The birth weight of an infant with a smoking mother is likely to be lower than that of an infant with a nonsmoking mother, which in turn would lead to a higher probability of high infant mortality. The health condition could still be present in an infant with a smoking mother, which would further increase the probability of high infant mortality.||",
