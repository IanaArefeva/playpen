The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. The overall probability of obesity is 9%. For normal weight people, the probability of long lifespan is 81%. For obese people, the probability of long lifespan is 49%. Is long lifespan more likely than short lifespan overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between smoking and long lifespan is that the probability of long lifespan is lower for people who smoke than for those who do not. Since the probability of long lifespan is lower for both obese and smoking groups than for the normal weight group, and the probability of long lifespan is lower for the normal weight group than for the general population, we can conclude that long lifespan is less likely than short lifespan overall.||",
