The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of high salary is 34%. For people who have a brother, the probability of high salary is 60%. For people who have a brother, would it be less likely to see high salary if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that having a brother is associated with higher skill and higher salary. If we condition on having a brother, we are already in a state where skill is higher than it would be without a brother. The additional information that the probability of high salary is 60% for people who have a brother does not change the fact that having a brother is still associated with higher skill and higher salary. Therefore, it would not be less likely to see a high salary if the person did not have a brother.<|eot_id|>",
