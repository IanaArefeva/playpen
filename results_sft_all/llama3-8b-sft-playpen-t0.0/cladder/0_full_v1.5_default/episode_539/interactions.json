The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on drug taken and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on drug taken. Drug taken has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 61%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of low cholesterol is 63%. For patients not assigned the drug treatment, the probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 39%. For patients assigned the drug treatment, the probability of taking of all assigned drugs is 63%. Will taking of all assigned drugs decrease the chance of low cholesterol?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of unobserved confounders on drug taken and cholesterol level is also positive, meaning that unobserved confounders are associated with higher likelihood of drug taken and lower likelihood of having high cholesterol. The direct effect of treatment assignment on drug taken is also positive, meaning that being assigned the drug treatment is associated with higher likelihood of drug taken. Since the drug taken has a direct positive effect on cholesterol level, and the unobserved confounders also have a positive effect on drug taken and cholesterol level, it is likely that drug taken will lead to lower likelihood of having high cholesterol, and higher likelihood of having low cholesterol.||",
