The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 55%. For people who have a brother, the probability of lung cancer is 65%. Will having a brother increase the chance of lung cancer?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key insight here is that the direct relationship between having a brother and lung cancer is likely a result of the unobserved common cause, which is the unobserved \"pollution\" variable. In other words, the increase in lung cancer probability among those with a brother is likely due to the higher level of pollution they are exposed to, rather than the brother itself. This is a classic example of a confounding variable, where the observed relationship between having a brother and lung cancer is spurious and not causal.<|eot_id|>",
