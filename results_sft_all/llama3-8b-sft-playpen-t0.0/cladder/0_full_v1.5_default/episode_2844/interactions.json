The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. We know that rainy season causes rain and sprinkler on. rain or sprinkler on causes wet ground. Would the ground is wet if dry season instead of rainy season?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
