Since rain is not present in the dry season, the direct effect of rain on ground is absent. The direct effect of the sprinkler on ground is also present in both scenarios, so that remains a possibility. The direct effect of the season on the ground is through the condition \"wet ground\" when rain is present, and since rain is not present in the dry season, that direct effect is also absent. The only remaining possibility is the direct effect of the sprinkler on ground, which is present in both scenarios.<|eot_id|>",
