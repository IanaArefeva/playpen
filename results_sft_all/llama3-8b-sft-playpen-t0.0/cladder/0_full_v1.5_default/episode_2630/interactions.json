The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. For nonsmokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 70%. For smokers, the probability of high tar deposit is 24%. For nonsmokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 90%. For nonsmokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 64%. For smokers and with no tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 84%. For smokers and with high tar deposit, the probability of lung cancer is 59%. The overall probability of smoking is 45%. Does smoking positively affect lung cancer through tar deposit?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer is not fully captured by the given probabilities, as the joint probability of smoking and lung cancer is not provided. The correct approach involves examining the joint probability of smoking and lung cancer, which is not directly available from the given information. The correct method involves using the law of total probability to condition on the unobserved variable, which is not directly accessible in this scenario.||",
