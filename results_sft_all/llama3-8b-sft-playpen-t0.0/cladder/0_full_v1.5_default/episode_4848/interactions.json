The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 9%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 33%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 6%. Is the chance of high rainfall larger when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

To do this, we need to first find the probability of high rainfall and then condition on the event that Alice wakes up late.\nThe probability of high rainfall is the sum of the probability of high rainfall and on-time wake-up and the probability of high rainfall and late wake-up, which is 33% + 6% = 39%.\nNext, we need to find the probability of late wake-up, which is 9%. Then, we can condition on the event that Alice wakes up late and find the probability of high rainfall given that event.\nThe probability of high rainfall and late wake-up is 6%. The probability of late wake-up is 9%. The probability of high rainfall is 39%. The target quantity is the probability of high rainfall given that Alice wakes up late, which is the number of high rainfall and late wake-up events (6%) divided by the number of late wake-up events (9%).\nThe target quantity is the number of high rainfall and late wake-up events (6%) divided by the number of late wake-up events (9%), which is 6/9 = 2/3.\nThe target quantity is the number of high rainfall and late wake-up events (6%) divided by the number of late wake-up events (9%), which is 2/3.\nThe target quantity is the number of high rainfall and late wake-up events",
