The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on ability to speak english and recovery. Ability to speak english has a direct effect on recovery. The overall probability of speaking english is 48%. The probability of not speaking english and recovery is 13%. The probability of speaking english and recovery is 36%. Is the chance of recovery smaller when observing speaking english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of not speaking English and recovery is 13%, which is lower than the probability of speaking English and recovery (36%). This suggests that the ability to speak English is associated with a higher likelihood of recovery, rather than a lower one.||",
