Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 96%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 64%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 38%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 8%. The overall probability of male gender is 49%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?",
