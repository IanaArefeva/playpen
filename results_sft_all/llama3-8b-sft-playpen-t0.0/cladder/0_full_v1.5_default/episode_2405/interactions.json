The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. For patients who are not male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 96%. For patients who are not male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 64%. For patients who are male and not receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 38%. For patients who are male and receiving treatment, the probability of recovery is 8%. The overall probability of male gender is 49%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be less likely to see recovery if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The counterfactual question being asked is whether, for patients who are already receiving treatment, it would be less likely to see recovery if they had instead not received treatment. In this case, we need to consider the counterfactual probability of recovery for patients who are already receiving treatment, and then condition on the fact that they are male or not male.\nFor male patients who are already receiving treatment, the counterfactual probability of recovery if they had not received treatment is 38% (the probability of recovery for male patients not receiving treatment), which is lower than the 8% probability of recovery for male patients who are already receiving treatment. This suggests that, for male patients, not receiving treatment would lead to lower recovery rates.\nHowever, for non-male patients who are already receiving treatment, the counterfactual probability of recovery if they had not received treatment is 96% (the probability of recovery for non-male patients not receiving treatment), which is higher than the 64% probability of recovery for non-male patients who are already receiving treatment. This suggests that, for non-male patients, not receiving treatment would lead to higher recovery rates.\nGiven that the overall probability of male gender is 49%, we can conclude that, for patients who are already receiving treatment, it would be less likely to see recovery if the patient had not been",
