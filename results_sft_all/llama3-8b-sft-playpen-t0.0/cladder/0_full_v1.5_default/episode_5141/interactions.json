The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 23%. For people without a college degree, the probability of large feet is 79%. For people with a college degree or higher, the probability of large feet is 29%.

Since the probability of large feet is higher (79%) than the probability of small feet (21%) among those without a college degree, and the probability of large feet is lower (29%) than the probability of small feet (71%) among those with a college degree or higher, we can conclude that large feet are more likely than small feet overall.||",
