The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. The overall probability of blowing out the candle is 15%. For people not blowing out candles, the probability of dark room is 83%. For people who blow out candles, the probability of dark room is 49%. Is dark room more likely than bright room overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of blowing out the candle is 0.15, we can weight the two probabilities by the likelihood of each action: (0.85 * 0.15) + (0.49 * 0.85) = 0.1275 + 0.4185 = 0.546. The probability of bright room is 1 - 0.546 = 0.454, which is higher than 0.546.<|eot_id|>",
