Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 59%. The probability of vaccine refusal and being lactose intolerant is 24%. The probability of getting the vaccine and being lactose intolerant is 20%.

The probability of being lactose intolerant in the general population is 24% (P(LI)). The probability of being vaccinated is 59% (P(V)). To find the probability of being lactose intolerant when the person has been vaccinated, we need to consider the joint probability of being both vaccinated and lactose intolerant, which is 20% (P(V ∩ LI)). The law of total probability states that the probability of being lactose intolerant when the person has been vaccinated is the joint probability of being both vaccinated and lactose intolerant, divided by the probability of being vaccinated: P(LI|V) = (P(V) * P(LI|V)) / P(V) = (0.59 * 0.20) / 0.59 = 0.20. This is the same as the probability of being lactose intolerant in the general population, which is 24%.<|eot_id|>",
