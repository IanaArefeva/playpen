Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 41%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 2%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 2%. Is talent less likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since 59% of the population is unattractive and 41% is attractive, the overall probability of having talent is a weighted average of the two groups, which is (0.59 * 0.02) + (0.41 * 0.02) = 0.02. The probability of lacking talent is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98. Since 0.02 is less than 0.98, talent is less likely than lack of talent overall.<|eot_id|>",
