The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 42%. For people who have a brother, the probability of smallpox survival is 41%. For people who have a brother, would it be more likely to see smallpox survival if the person did not have a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that having a brother is not a positive factor for smallpox survival; rather, it is a negative factor. If we consider a person who does not have a brother, we already know that their probability of smallpox survival is 42%. If we then condition on the person not having a brother, we are not adding any new information that would increase their probability of smallpox survival. In fact, we are still bound by the same 42% probability, which is higher than the 41% probability associated with having a brother.||",
