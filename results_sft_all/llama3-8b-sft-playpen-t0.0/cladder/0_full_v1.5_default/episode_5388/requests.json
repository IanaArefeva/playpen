The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and lactose intolerance. Parents' social status has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 92%. For children with unintelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 85%. For children with intelligent parents and with low parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 51%. For children with intelligent parents and with high parental social status, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 47%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 80%. For children with unintelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 34%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder inactive, the probability of high parental social status is 44%. For children with intelligent parents and confounder active, the probability of high parental social status is 12%. The overall probability of confounder active is 52%. Does parents' intelligence positively affect lactose intolerance through parents' social status?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key insight here is that the probability of children being lactose intolerant is different across different groups of parents (unintelligent vs. intelligent) and social status (low vs. high), which suggests that parents' social status is a confounding variable that needs to be accounted for. The direct effect of parents' intelligence on children's lactose intolerance is not isolated from the effect of parents' social status, which further affects the probability of children being lactose intolerant.<|eot_id|>",
