The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 26%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 66%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 9%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 62%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 44%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 100%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the positive direct effect of smoking on college admission is not offset by any negative direct or indirect effects, we conclude that smoking does not negatively affect college admission in this world.<|eot_id|>",
