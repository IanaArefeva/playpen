For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 66%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 9%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 62%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 44%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 100%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect college admission?",
