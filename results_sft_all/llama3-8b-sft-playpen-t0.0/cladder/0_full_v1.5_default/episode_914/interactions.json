The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 26%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 66%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 9%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 62%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 44%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 100%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking negatively affect college admission?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
