The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Playing card games has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. Method 1: We look at how playing card games correlates with lifespan case by case according to diabetes. Method 2: We look directly at how playing card games correlates with lifespan in general. To understand how playing card games affects lifespan, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In the given world, there is a direct link between diabetes and lifespan, and a direct link between smoking and both diabetes and lifespan. Since we do not have direct information about the relationship between smoking and the other two variables, we must consider the possibility that the observed relationship between playing card games and lifespan might be spurious, being entirely due to the unobserved relationship between smoking and the other two variables. In this case, looking at the relationship between playing card games and lifespan in general (Method 2) might lead to a more reliable conclusion than looking at the relationship case by case according to diabetes (Method 1), as the latter could still be subject to spuriousness.||",
