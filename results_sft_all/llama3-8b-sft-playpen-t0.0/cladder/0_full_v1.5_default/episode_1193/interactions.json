The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and infant mortality. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on infant mortality. Health condition is unobserved. For infants with nonsmoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 70%. For infants with smoking mothers, the probability of high infant mortality is 77%. For infants with smoking mothers, would it be less likely to see high infant mortality if the infant had a nonsmoking mother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The health condition is unobserved, so we can't directly account for its influence. The birth weight, which is directly related to both the health condition and the maternal smoking, is the key intervening variable here. The birth weight is more likely to be lower in the case of a smoking mother, which in turn would lead to higher infant mortality. The health condition could still play a role in this chain of causality, but we can't directly measure it. The direct relationship between the health condition and the birth weight isn't accounted for in the given information. The birth weight is the key intervening variable that we need to consider in this chain of causality.
