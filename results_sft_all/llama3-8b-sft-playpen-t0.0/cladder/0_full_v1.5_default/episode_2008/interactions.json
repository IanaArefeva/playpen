The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 53%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 64%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 80%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 50%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct effect of college degree or higher on high salary is not quantified in the given information. The probability of high salary is higher for people living close to a college (64%) than for those living far from a college (53%), which might imply that living close to a college has a positive effect on the probability of high salary. The probability of college degree or higher is higher for people living far from a college (80%) than for those living close to a college (50%), which might imply that living far from a college has a positive effect on the probability of college degree or higher. The unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both education level and salary, which further complicates the relationship between college degree or higher and high salary.||",
