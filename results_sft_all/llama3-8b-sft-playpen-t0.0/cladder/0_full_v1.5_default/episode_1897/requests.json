Talent has a direct effect on fame. For people who are famous, the correlation between attractive appearance and talent is -0.01. If we look at people who are famous, does it mean that attractive appearance does not affect talent?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between these variables is still subject to the direct effects of both appearance and talent on fame. The negative correlation could be a result of the intervening variable \"fame\" canceling out the direct relationship between appearance and talent, rather than a direct disconnection between the two.<|eot_id|>",
