Proximity to a college has a direct effect on drinking coffee. Drinking coffee has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. We know that confounder active or close to a college causes drinking coffee. confounder active and drinking coffee causes high salary. We observed the person lives far from a college and confounder inactive. Would the employee has a high salary if drinking coffee instead of not drinking coffee?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The person's living far from a college means that the direct effect of the college on the person's coffee consumption is also zero. The person's coffee consumption is not directly related to their salary in this setting, as the direct effect of coffee on the person's salary is also zero. The only remaining direct relationship is that the person's unobserved confounder has a direct effect on their coffee consumption, which is also zero. Since all direct relationships between the person's coffee consumption and their salary are zero, we conclude that the person's coffee consumption does not affect their salary.<|eot_id|>",
