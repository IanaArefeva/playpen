The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and lactose intolerance. Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. We know that smoking causes being lazy. smoking and being hard-working causes being lactose intolerant. Would the student is not lactose intolerant if smoking instead of nonsmoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

If the person is not lactose intolerant, it means they are more likely to be hardworking. Since being hardworking is associated with being lactose intolerant, and being lazy is associated with not being lactose intolerant, the person's condition of not being lactose intolerant is more likely to be a result of being a non-smoker rather than a smoker.||",
