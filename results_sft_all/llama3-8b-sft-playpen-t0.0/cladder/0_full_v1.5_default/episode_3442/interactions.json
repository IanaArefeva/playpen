The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of solar eclipse is 32%. The probability of no solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 41%. The probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 10%. Is the chance of arriving to school on time larger when observing solar eclipse?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the probability of no solar eclipse is 68%. The probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time is 10%. To find the probability of solar eclipse and arriving to school on time, we need to consider the joint probability of solar eclipse and no solar eclipse. The joint probability of solar eclipse and no solar eclipse is the same as the probability of solar eclipse, which is 32%. The joint probability of no solar eclipse and no solar eclipse is the same as the probability of no solar eclipse, which is 68%.
