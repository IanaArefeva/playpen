The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. For children with unintelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 58%. For children with intelligent parents, the probability of intelligent child is 33%. For children with intelligent parents, would it be less likely to see intelligent child if the child had unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that children with intelligent parents are less likely to be intelligent than children with unintelligent parents. If we condition on the child having intelligent parents, we are already in a state where the child is more likely to be intelligent than if the child had unintelligent parents. The additional information that the child has intelligent parents does not reduce the likelihood of the child being intelligent; rather, it shifts the focus to a different set of parents (those with intelligent children) where the child is already more likely to be intelligent.<|eot_id|>",
