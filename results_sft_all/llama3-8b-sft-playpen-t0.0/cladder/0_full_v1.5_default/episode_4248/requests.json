The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and lip thickness. Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 7%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 18%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 81%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 91%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 54%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see thick lips if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The treatment also has a direct effect on thick lips, and this interaction between kidney stone size and treatment is what really matters. In particular, for patients who have large kidney stones and are not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 81%, which is higher than the 18% probability for patients with small kidney stones and treatment. This suggests that the large kidney stone size is the primary driver of thick lips in this case, rather than the absence of treatment. In other words, the large kidney stone size \"overpowers\" the effect of not receiving treatment in this particular scenario.<|eot_id|>",
