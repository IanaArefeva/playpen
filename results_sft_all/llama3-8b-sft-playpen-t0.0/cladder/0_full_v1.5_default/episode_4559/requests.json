The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 28%. The probability of not liking spicy food and cholera contraction is 60%. The probability of liking spicy food and cholera contraction is 13%. Is the chance of cholera contraction larger when observing liking spicy food?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of cholera contraction is more likely to be associated with the unobserved condition of poverty, which has a direct effect on both liking spicy food and cholera. The observed probability of 28% for liking spicy food and 13% for the joint occurrence of liking spicy food and cholera contraction do not directly imply that the chance of cholera contraction is larger when observing liking spicy food.<|eot_id|>",
