The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 64%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 37%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The direct relationship between effort and college admission is that higher effort leads to higher college admission probability. Since the student is a smoker, the direct negative effect of smoking on college admission probability supersedes any potential positive effect of higher effort. In this specific case, the student's smoking status is the primary factor determining their college admission probability, and higher effort does not counteract the negative effect of smoking.||",
