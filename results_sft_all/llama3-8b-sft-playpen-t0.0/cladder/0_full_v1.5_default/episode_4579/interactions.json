The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 98%. For people who do not have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 51%. For people who have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 63%. For people who have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 17%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of alarm set by wife is 36%. For people who have a brother, the probability of alarm set by wife is 93%. If we disregard the mediation effect through wife, would having a brother positively affect alarm clock?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of the alarm clock ringing is higher when a person has a brother and their wife sets the alarm (17%) than when they have a brother and their wife doesn't set the alarm (63%). This counterintuitive result suggests that having a brother might not directly influence the alarm clock, and the relationship might be more complex than initially thought.||",
