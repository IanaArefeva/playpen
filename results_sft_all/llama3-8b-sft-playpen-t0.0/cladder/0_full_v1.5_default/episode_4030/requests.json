Effort has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. For nonsmokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 63%. For smokers, the probability of being lactose intolerant is 42%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see being lactose intolerant if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If we condition on the student being a smoker, the additional information that the student would have been a nonsmoker does not change the probability of being lactose intolerant, which remains lower than that of a typical nonsmoker.<|eot_id|>",
