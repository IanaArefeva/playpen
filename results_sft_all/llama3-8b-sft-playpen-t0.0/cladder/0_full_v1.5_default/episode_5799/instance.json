Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people who do not have a brother and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 54%. For people who do not have a brother and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 55%. For people who have a brother and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 69%. For people who have a brother and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 51%. For people who do not have a brother and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 95%. For people who do not have a brother and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 37%. For people who have a brother and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 58%. For people who have a brother and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 9%. The overall probability of high pollution is 40%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smoking, would having a brother positively affect lung cancer?",
