The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of listening to jazz is 47%. For students who do not listen to jazz, the probability of being hard-working is 57%. For students who listen to jazz, the probability of being hard-working is 57%. Is being hard-working more likely than being lazy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since the probability of being hard-working is the same in both groups, and the overall probability of listening to jazz is 47%, we can conclude that the fraction of the population that is hard-working is the same as the fraction that is not hard-working. This is because the 47% who do not listen to jazz are all hard-working, and the 53% who do listen to jazz are also all hard-working. Since the two groups are of equal size, we can conclude that the fraction of the population that is hard-working is the same as the fraction that is not hard-working, which means that being hard-working is not more likely than being lazy overall.||",
