The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 44%. For students who are not talented, the probability of being hard-working is 54%. For students who are talented, the probability of being hard-working is 54%. Is being hard-working more likely than being lazy overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since 44% of the students are talented and 56% are not, the overall probability of being hard-working is a weighted average of the two groups. The weight of the non-talented group is 56% (1 - 0.44), and the weight of the talented group is 44%. Since the probability of being hard-working is the same for both groups (54%), the overall probability of being hard-working is also 54%. In this world, being hard-working is not more likely than being lazy overall.<|eot_id|>",
