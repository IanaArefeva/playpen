The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Brown eyes has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. The overall probability of talent is 86%. For students who are not talented, the probability of brown eyes is 96%. For students who are talented, the probability of brown eyes is 96%. Is brown eyes more likely than blue eyes overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the probability of being talented is 86%, and the probability of brown eyes is the same for both talented and non-talented students, we can conclude that the overall probability of brown eyes is not higher than the probability of blue eyes.<|eot_id|>",
