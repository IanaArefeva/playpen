For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 80%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 34%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 56%. For individuals who are not male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 78%. For individuals who are not male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 100%. For individuals who are male and out-of-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 42%. For individuals who are male and in-state residents, the probability of competitive department is 70%. The overall probability of in-state residency is 20%. If we disregard the mediation effect through department competitiveness, would gender positively affect admission status?",
